Their son Jody is 11 years old; he gets along well with his warm and affectionate pa, but his ma is haunted by the death of her other children, so she's somber, even cold. The boy wants a pet: the dad is sympathetic, the mom obdurate. When a rattler bites pa, pa kills a doe to use its organs to draw out the poison. Jody begs to keep the doe's fawn as a pet. The parents agree, and the boy and the deer are soon inseparable. The fawn grows quickly, and as a yearling tramples tobacco shoots and eats the newly-sprouted corn. This is too much for ma, and Jody has to face harsh, adult realities.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 39111, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 4048}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:33:56.140000000", "plot": "A boy persuades his parents to allow him to adopt a young deer, but what will happen if the deer misbehaves?", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NjVhMDMtZTZmMy00MWYwLTkyMjQtMDEyMmVkYmJmOTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -715478400000, "runtime": 128, "title": "The Yearling", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1031011200000, "fresh": 14, "lastUpdated": 1439662856000, "production": "MGM Home Entertainment", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 3708, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Osborn (screen play)", "Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (based on the Pulitzer Prize novel by)"], "year": 1946}
