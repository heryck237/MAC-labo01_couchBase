To help Lou recover from car-exhaust poisoning, Adam and Nick, with Adam's nephew Jacob, go to a winter resort that was their old party place. It's now a dump, but the lads rally for a night of drinking in the hot tub. Somehow, the hot tub takes them back to 1986, on a fateful night for each of them. Maybe if they do everything the same way they did that night, they'll get back to the future so Jacob can be born. There are serious temptations to do things differently. Will they make it back to their sorry lives? And what about Jacob?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 1231587, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 131992}, "languages": ["English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:17:14.287000000", "metacritic": 63, "plot": "A malfunctioning time machine at a ski resort takes a man back to 1986 with his two friends and nephew, where they must relive a fateful night and not change anything to make sure the nephew is born.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjExODA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYwMDYxMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1269561600000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Hot Tub Time Machine", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$48.9M", "consensus": "Its flagrantly silly script -- and immensely likable cast -- make up for most of its flaws.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 199, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1277769600000, "fresh": 126, "lastUpdated": 1442078872000, "production": "MGM", "rotten": 73, "viewer": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 166341, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://Kicksomepast.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Josh Heald (screenplay)", "Sean Anders (screenplay)", "John Morris (screenplay)", "Josh Heald (story)"], "year": 2010}
