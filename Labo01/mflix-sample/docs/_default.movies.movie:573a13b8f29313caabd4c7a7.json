He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests Hawaii, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he's checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a polymorphously perverse English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she's lost, and what about Rachel?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 800039, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 203644}, "languages": ["English", "Hawaiian", "German", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:03:13.843000000", "metacritic": 67, "plot": "Devastated Peter takes a Hawaiian vacation in order to deal with the recent break-up with his TV star girlfriend, Sarah.
