For Lance Barton, a struggling comedian and bicycle messenger, it's the last thing on his mind. His due date upstairs is 50 years away. In the meantime, he's got big dreams to pursue on Earth, such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though - he ain't that funny. Thanks to an over-cautious emissary from heaven, Mr. Keyes, he's going to get hit (literally) with a much bigger problem. Showing that even God has difficulty finding good help these days, the inept minion mistakenly plucks Lance from a traffic accident - before it takes place. Transporting him to the Pearly Gates, or more accurately, the velvet roped-lines of the hottest club around, the error is finally addressed by Mr. King, the streetwise, no-nonsense head angel who manages the place from his plush windowed office. Since returning to his own body on Earth is impossible, the urban dwelling Lance reluctantly agrees to a normally unthinkable proposal. He'll occupy the body of a wealthy old white mogul, Charles Wellington, until a more suitable body can be found. Strangely enough, in a Park Avenue penthouse, servants and butlers become his new homeys as Lance works on his streetwise comedy routine for the big Apollo showdown. Living in the body of a callous old white man would be bizarre enough for Lance without falling in love with Sontee, the beautiful woman publicly battling Wellington's company at the same time. And if that wasn't enough, he's got to deal with the love affair between Wellington's wife and his personal assistant, and their plot to have him killed. Can reincarnation lead to self discovery, true love and a better stand up routine? Lance Barton is about to find out.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 231775, "rating": 5.4, "votes": 18221}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:10:44.033000000", "metacritic": 32, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "After dying before his time, an aspiring comic gets a second shot at life...by being reincarnated as a wealthy but un-likeable businessman.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNmODQ5N2QtMzEwMy00MjRmLWE1MzEtZmUyZmQ3ZmIzYmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 982281600000, "runtime": 87, "title": "Down to Earth", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$63.1M", "consensus": "A toned down Chris Rock fails to bring a limp script to life as the movie moves from one gag to the next.", "critic": {"meter": 20, "numReviews": 96, "rating": 3.9}, "dvd": 1007424000000, "fresh": 19, "lastUpdated": 1441045208000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 77, "viewer": {"meter": 41, "numReviews": 62387, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://www.downtoearthmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Elaine May", "Warren Beatty", "Chris Rock (screenplay)", "Lance Crouther (screenplay)", "Ali LeRoi (screenplay)", "Louis C.K.
