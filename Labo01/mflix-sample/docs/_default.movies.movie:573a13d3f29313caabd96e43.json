Connecting past, present and future is a unique relationship with the eider duck. Eider down, the warmest feather in the world, allows both Inuit and bird to survive harsh Arctic winters. Traditional life is juxtaposed with modern challenges as both Inuit and eiders confront changing sea ice and ocean currents disrupted by the massive hydroelectric dams powering New York and eastern North America. Inspired by Inuit ingenuity and the technology of a simple feather, the film is a call to action to implement energy solutions that work with nature.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1929346, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 77}, "languages": ["English", "Inuktitut"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-04 01:03:22.833000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Featuring stunning footage from seven winters in the Arctic, People of a Feather takes you through time into the world of the Inuit on the Belcher Islands in Canada's Hudson Bay.
