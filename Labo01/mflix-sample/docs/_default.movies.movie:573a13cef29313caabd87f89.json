He also moonlights with a tutoring center called Chatwal Coaching Class in order to make ends meet. Hoping to pacify his family with his income-tax refund, he will instead be compelled to give up its entire amount after his Meerut-based sister Urmi invites them over to a wedding. He borrows a car from a neighbor, Farooqui, and, after a rather dramatic trip, is forced to compensate him as the car gets damaged. Unable to bear taunts that he cannot afford a car, he decides to buy one. It is this decision that will force Payal to seek employment in a call center. Sandeep will confess that he has been gambling, which leaves Santosh with no alternative but to consider accepting bribes from students and risk being exposed on live TV.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1714832, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 2827}, "languages": ["Hindi"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:22:48.203000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A middle class family in India tries to buy a new car.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcyMmMzZWUtNzkyZC00ZGJiLThhZTAtOGNjMjdiYTUxOWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1286496000000, "title": "Do Dooni Chaar", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1311638400000, "lastUpdated": 1439749084000, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 226, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Habib Faisal (screenplay)", "Rahil Qazi (screenplay)"], "year": 2010}
