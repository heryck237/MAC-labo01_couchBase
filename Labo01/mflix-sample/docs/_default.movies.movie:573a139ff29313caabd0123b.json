The complex strictures of class bind a man and a woman. Miss Julie, the inexperienced but imperious daughter of the manor, deigns to dance at the servant's party. She's also drawn to Jean, a footman who has traveled, speaks well, and doesn't kowtow. He is engaged to Christine, a servant, and while she sleeps, Jean and Miss Julie talk through the night in the kitchen. For part of the night it's a power struggle, for part it's the bearing of souls, and by dawn, they want to break the chains of class and leave Sweden together. When Christine wakes and goes off to church, Jean and Miss Julie have their own decisions to make.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 189744, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 1271}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:22:41.407000000", "metacritic": 46, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A footman seduces a count's daughter.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjUyOTIzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg4ODMyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 967766400000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Miss Julie", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 39, "numReviews": 23, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 959644800000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1434824663000, "production": "United Artists Films", "rotten": 14, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 995, "rating": 3.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Helen Cooper (screenplay)", "August Strindberg (play)"], "year": 1999}
