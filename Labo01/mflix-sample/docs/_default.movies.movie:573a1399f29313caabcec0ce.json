Wendy clerks in a shop, leads aerobics at a primary school, jokes like a vaudevillian, agrees to waitress at a friend's new restaurant and dotes on Andy, a cook who forever puts off home remodeling projects, and with a drunken friend, buys a broken down lunch wagon. Natalie, with short neat hair and a snappy, droll manner, is a plumber; she has a holiday planned in America, but little else. Last is Nicola, odd man out: a snarl, big glasses, cigarette, mussed hair, jittery fingers, bulimic, jobless, and unhappy. How they interact and play out family conflict and love is the film's subject.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 100024, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 5708}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:19:46.063000000", "metacritic": 88, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Just north of London live Wendy, Andy, and their twenty-something twins, Natalie and Nicola.
