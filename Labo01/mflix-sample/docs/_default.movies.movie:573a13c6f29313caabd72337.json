Boxers who fought him describe what led up to major fights and the matches themselves; they also offer personal revelations about their own lives: George Chuvalo's family losses, George Foreman's conversion, Ken Norton's gratitude, Ron Lyle's teaching, Earnie Shaver's encounter with the Klan, and Joe Frazier's good humor pack their own punch. The fighters talk about Ali's quickness, cunning, and recuperative powers - and how fighting him changed their lives.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 1419318, "rating": 8, "votes": 2159}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:58:15.177000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Ten of Muhammad Ali's former rivals pay tribute to the three-time world heavyweight champion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MzkzMTY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE4ODMwMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1292457600000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Facing Ali", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1262044800000, "lastUpdated": 1442424582000, "production": "Lionsgate Films", "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 618, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.facingalimovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Pete McCormack"], "year": 2009}
