The Nazi's have the upper edge as the Allies are unable to crack their war codes. That is, until a wrecked U-boat sends out an SOS signal, and the Allies realise this is their chance to seize the 'enigma coding machine'. But masquerading as Nazi's and taking over the U-boat is the smallest of their problems. The action really begins when they get stranded on the U-boat.", "genres": ["Action", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 141926, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 62545}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 00:36:53.233000000", "metacritic": 62, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A German submarine is boarded by disguised American submariners trying to capture their Enigma cipher machine.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE0YzUwMzMtY2NhZS00OGYxLWFhOWItN2ZlZThjOTA0NDQ4L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 956275200000, "runtime": 116, "title": "U-571", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make U-571 a tense thriller.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 115, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 972345600000, "fresh": 78, "lastUpdated": 1439921570000, "production": "Universal Studios Home Video", "rotten": 37, "viewer": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 56415, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.u-571.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jonathan Mostow (story)", "Jonathan Mostow (screenplay)", "Sam Montgomery (screenplay)", "David Ayer (screenplay)"], "year": 2000}
