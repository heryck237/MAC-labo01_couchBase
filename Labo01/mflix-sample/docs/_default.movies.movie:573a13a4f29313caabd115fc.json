A fugitive priest, he then witnesses the murder of a traveling performer--and subsequently, the mourning of actor by his fellow troupe members. He eventually becomes initiated into the troupe as a player, replacing the murdered man. They travel from town to town performing their standard morality play. They arrive in a town where a boy has been killed and a young deaf-mute girl has been imprisoned for the crime--sentenced to death for witchcraft and murder. Discarding the expected bible stories, the actors stage a performance based on the crime. Through the performance of the play, they discover that the townspeople know the young woman did not, in fact, commit the murder. The stage becomes a place where vital human truth is told. Thus, simultaneously, the fugitive priest comes to terms with his own crime and makes a powerful sacrifice, thereby redeeming himself.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 258816, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 4790}, "languages": ["English", "Latin"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:41:00.303000000", "metacritic": 49, "plot": "A priest on the lam takes up with a traveling band of actors, who then discover a murder has occurred and try to solve it by recreating the crime in a play.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NTY5Mzk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA1MDUyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1086307200000, "runtime": 112, "title": "The Reckoning", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A talky, ponderous movie.", "critic": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 87, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 1091491200000, "fresh": 35, "lastUpdated": 1442165725000, "production": "Paramount Classics", "rotten": 52, "viewer": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 4719, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.paramountclassics.com/reckoning/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Barry Unsworth (novel)", "Mark Mills (screenplay)"], "year": 2002}
