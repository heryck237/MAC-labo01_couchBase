But a routine excavation turns to disaster when the porous ground collapses and he falls into a deep crevice and near certain death. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they start to suspect that the life-form they have discovered is not without danger.", "genres": ["Horror", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1709143, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 25645}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:15:29.960000000", "metacritic": 46, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A group of astronaut explorers succumb one by one to a mysterious and terrifying force while collecting specimens on Mars.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4ODgxMDU0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg0NzcyMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1379548800000, "runtime": 98, "title": "The Last Days on Mars", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$23.8k", "consensus": "Neither intelligent enough to work as thought-provoking sci-fi nor trashy enough to provide B-movie thrills, The Last Days on Mars proves as cinematically barren as the titular planet.", "critic": {"meter": 20, "numReviews": 55, "rating": 4.8}, "dvd": 1393891200000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1441907464000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 44, "viewer": {"meter": 25, "numReviews": 9976, "rating": 2.6}, "website": "http://www.magnetreleasing.com/thelastdaysonmars"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sydney J.
