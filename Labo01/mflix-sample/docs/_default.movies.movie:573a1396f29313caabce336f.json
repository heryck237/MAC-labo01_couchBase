The administration is concerned mainly with forms and rules (there's an up and and a down staircase); bells ring at the wrong time. Nevertheless, she tries. How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term. Can she make it?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 62425, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1334}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:24:21.780000000", "plot": "The experiences of a young female English teacher in an inner-city New York high school.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNiYmQyY2UtNjkwYi00OTNjLThhZTYtNjcyYzQyZmNlNWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -77500800000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Up the Down Staircase", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1194307200000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1441905863000, "production": "WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 367, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bel Kaufman (novel)", "Tad Mosel (screenplay)"], "year": 1967}
