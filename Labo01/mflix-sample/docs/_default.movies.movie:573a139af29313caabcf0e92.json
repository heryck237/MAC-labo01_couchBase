Stephen Wilson, a.k.a. the Eye, comes across a disturbed lady serial-killer while on an otherwise mundane assignment. Already a bit psychologically fragile from his wife's abrupt removal of herself and their daughter from his life (with the lingering memory of his daughter haunting him like a manifest ghost), his psychosis as a displaced dad dovetails with the femme fatale's psychosis as an abandoned daughter (crying \"Merry Christmas, Daddy\" over her expired victims). A bond forms, or, rather, an obsession, as the Eye abandons his job to secretively stalk this mysterious woman full-time as she visits many major U.S. cities under various names, leaving numerous victims.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 120662, "rating": 4.9, "votes": 12992}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:31:48.517000000", "metacritic": 29, "plot": "A private eye shadows a female serial killer of men all over the U.S. without her knowing as he, strangely enough, occasionally acts as her guardian angel.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2Mzk0MDcxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzI4NDI5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 949017600000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Eye of the Beholder", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Improbable and muddled.", "critic": {"meter": 9, "numReviews": 86, "rating": 3.4}, "dvd": 959040000000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1441130706000, "production": "Desintation Film Dist.
