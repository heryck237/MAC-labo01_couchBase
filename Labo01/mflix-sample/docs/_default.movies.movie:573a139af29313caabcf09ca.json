It reflects all different facets of society over one drivers shift. He starts out it seems as a cold, ignorant man. But his character develops as the different people of Chicago come & go. His character shows through when he tells a woman the truth about one of the huys he has in his cab. One highlight of this is the amount of cameos by well known faces who seem to be doing this film for the craic. The cab driver reacts well to the madness surrounding him & you can almost share his tiredness at the end of the shift. Crackheads, stoners, posh randy lawyers, irate Pakistanis and the high & lows of the working day are dealt with in this low budget film.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 119278, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 1621}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-03 00:19:35.380000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "There is more to this story than this review lets on.
