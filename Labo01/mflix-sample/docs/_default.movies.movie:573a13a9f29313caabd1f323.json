In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American, Frank T. Hopkins, and his horse to enter the race for the first time. During the course of his career, Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry--and had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The Sheik puts his claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world's greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders--some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival as he and his horse attempt the impossible.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Western"], "imdb": {"id": 317648, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 65369}, "languages": ["English", "Arabic", "Sioux"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:46:39.750000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In 1890, a down-and-out cowboy and his horse travel to Arabia to compete in a deadly cross desert horse race.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNjg5MjcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQxMzQyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1078444800000, "runtime": 136, "title": "Hidalgo", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$67.2M", "consensus": "The scenery looks great, but this overstuffed horse story contains too much cheese.", "critic": {"meter": 47, "numReviews": 158, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 1091491200000, "fresh": 74, "lastUpdated": 1442336562000, "production": "Buena Vista Pictures", "rotten": 84, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 130173, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.disney.com/hidalgo"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Fusco"], "year": 2004}
