They tan, swim, play volleyball, basketball, drink, dance and then find someone to spend the night with. Many grew out of their student phase and can afford a more comfortable holiday but when July comes they grab a tent, jump into their cars and come here. Here, nobody talks about work and the size of your wallet means nothing. The focus shifts from one main character, to another, to a third and then back to the first with the ending being about the fourth who was the main hero in the previous episode.
