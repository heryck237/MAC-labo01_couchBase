But one day, a chance meeting with a stranger Aditya (Vivek) on a morning train to Marine Lines changes it all. It is a case of love at first sight. The two get married. Suhani gladly accepts whatever Aditya has to offer # a dingy room with unplastered walls, rickety furniture and a makeshift kitchen.
