After the suicide, Farr tracks down other gay men being extorted for money by the same blackmailer. The well-educated police Detective Inspector Harris considers the sodomy law nothing more than an aid to blackmailers, and helps Farr in calling his blackmailer's bluff. The movie, far ahead of its time, ends with Farr and his wife coming to terms with his homosexuality after the public exposure he faces in the blackmailer's trial.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 55597, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 3107}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:27:53.813000000", "plot": "A prominent lawyer goes after a blackmailer who threatens gay men with exposure (homosexual acts still being illegal).
