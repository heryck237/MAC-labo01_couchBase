Jack finds a small-town mentality, with pluses and minuses. There's also a recent burglary and lots of missing cash. Jack gets a job oystering; his boss is separated from a woman of invention, Jack's attracted to a chambermaid turned letter carrier, and there are plenty of mine fields for a city boy to step through. Jack also has a sister, who's ill, to worry about. It's a river journey of self discovery. Is he passing through, or has he found home?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 379918, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 1030}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:24:15.627000000", "metacritic": 51, "plot": "A love story about a young man who runs away up an isolated Australian river and gets a job with eighth generation oyster famers.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MTUxNzMzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzMTIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1120089600000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Oyster Farmer", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anna Reeves"], "year": 2004}
