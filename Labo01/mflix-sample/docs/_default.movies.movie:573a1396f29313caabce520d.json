We first meet them ten years into their marriage. He is a college professor, she a divorce lawyer. They say that they are happily married - unlike their friends Katarina and Peter who openly fight, especially when under the influence of alcohol - but there is a certain detached aloofness in the way they treat each other. In the next ten years, as they contemplate or embark upon divorce and/or known extramarital affairs, they come to differing understandings at each phase of their relationship of what they truly mean to each other. Regardless of if it's love or hate - between which there is a fine line - they also come to certain understandings of how they can best relate to each other, whether that be as husband and wife, friends, lovers or none of the above.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 70644, "rating": 8.5, "votes": 10766}, "languages": ["Swedish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:53:59.120000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Ten years of Marianne and Johan's relationship are presented.
