She flashes back and remembers her coming-of-age. Her recollections are sometimes less than sweet, particularly those of her troubled and alcoholic step-father. Her memories of Robin, her first-love, are much happier and she also recalls her colorful Aunt Starr -- who's visit is fun but also detrimental to her family's health. The setting of 1950s Las Vegas' bomb testing is increasingly significant to the development of the story.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 90934, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 789}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-08 00:00:44.083000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story involves Rose Chismore's youth.
