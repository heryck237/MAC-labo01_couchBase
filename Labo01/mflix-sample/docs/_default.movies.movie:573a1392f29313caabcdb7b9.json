He also inherits, by way of his doorstep, an unwanted baby girl, Jean Johnson, whom he adopts into his family, rears and loves as his own. Practicing his profession for pigs, I.O.U.s and a lot of empty promises as payment, he is barely able to provide for his family, yet is successful ultimately. Dr. Abbott is dedicated to the welfare of his community and well-being of his patients (mostly lower class working folks of the rural town), but must battle a group of miserly businessmen at every twist and turn. He encounters resistance by the local bureaucracy for every progressive idea or beneficial proposal, made for the betterment of the community, yet his altruistic optimism is not hampered by the penny-pinching bureaucrats interested more in lining their own pockets, rather than helping the town and its struggling population.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 30410, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 279}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-06 00:53:57.643000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Doctor John Abbott is a single parent who settles in the town of Westport, with his son Dick, trying to eke out a living for them.
