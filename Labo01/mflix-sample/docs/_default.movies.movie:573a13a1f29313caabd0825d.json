One night he surprises an intruder, who turns out to be a kid, almost 8 years old. There's something oddly familiar about the chubby lad, whose name is Rusty. The boy's identity sparks a journey into Russ's past that the two of them take - to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. Two long-suffering women look on with disbelief: Russ's secretary, Janet, and his assistant, the lovely Amy, to whom Rusty takes a shine. What, and who, is at the end of this journey?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 219854, "rating": 6, "votes": 32935}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 09:11:08.757000000", "metacritic": 45, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "An unhappy and disliked image consultant gets a second shot at life when an eight year old version of himself mysteriously appears.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTYwM2JmNzgtNzVjMi00NzQ4LTk2MDQtOTE4N2U0ODU0YjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 962928000000, "runtime": 104, "title": "The Kid", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$68.5M", "consensus": "Critics find The Kid to be too sweet and the movie's message to be annoyingly simplistic.", "critic": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 97, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1043280000000, "fresh": 48, "lastUpdated": 1441992106000, "production": "Disney", "rotten": 49, "viewer": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 60425, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/thekid/homepage.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Audrey Wells"], "year": 2000}
