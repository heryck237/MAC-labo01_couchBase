Rugged contractor Rick eyes Beth but ends up going home with the more assertive Debby. Beth's style is further cramped by the responsibilities of single motherhood. As Debby tries to parlay what was essentially a casual fling into possible marriage with an indifferent Rick, her mother Virginia wonders if her affair with widower Nick is the real thing. Rounding out the romantic possibilities is Bobby, the bartender who flirts with Beth. The women clash as plans go awry, tragedy strikes, and hearts get broken. In the end, Debby, Beth, and Virginia find, if not the relationships of their dreams, peace with each other and within themselves.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 290664, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 2797}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-28 00:48:03.947000000", "plot": "Two friends lament their unhappy single lives while searching for Mr. Right in 1980s New Jersey.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MDk1NjE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjgzNjk5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-MA", "released": 1029888000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Hysterical Blindness", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 10, "rating": 5.4}, "dvd": 1050364800000, "fresh": 7, "lastUpdated": 1438797935000, "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 3880, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Laura Cahill (play)", "Laura Cahill (teleplay)"], "year": 2002}
