When a jaguar attacks Abeguar and Jana\u00e8na, he jumps off a cliff with her and he flies. The shaman advises Abeguar that he was the chosen one by the god Munh\u00e8 to lead his tribe and fight against the evil Anhang\u00e8. When the tribe leader Piat\u00e8 joins the French in the fight against the Portuguese, the entire Tupinamb\u00e8s are slaughtered and Abeguar turns into a bird that flies for more than two hundred years to find Janaina. In 1825, the warrior is Manuel Balaio that lives with Jana\u00e8na and their two daughters in Maranh\u00e8o. When one of his daughters is raped by the abusive police commander, Balaio leads the oppressed locals against the police and they take down the Caxias city. The government sends Duque de Caxias and his troops that vanquish the rebels and Balaio turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred and forty years to find Jana\u00e8na again. In 1968, in Rio, the warrior is Cau, but Jana\u00e8na is a revolutionary student that lives with another insurgent. When Cau and Jana\u00e8na are arrested by the repressive police, Cau rats the insurgents to protect Jana\u00e8na from the torture and he becomes an outcast by his former fellows. Only the jailer Feij\u00e8o talks to him and Cau teaches him politics. With the amnesty, Cau moves to the slums with Feij\u00e8o and becomes a teacher and member of the criminal group Falange Vermelha. When the police invade the slum, Cau turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred years to find Jana\u00e8na again. In 2096, in Rio de Janeiro, very few people can afford water that is mostly used in the ethanol plantations by the governmental company Aquabr\u00e8s. The warrior is now a journalist and Jana\u00e8na a call-girl. When the president of Aquabr\u00e8s is kidnapped by a group of insurgents, the warrior sees Jana\u00e8na on television and heads to Aquabr\u00e8s to save her.", "genres": ["Animation", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 2231208, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 715}, "languages": ["Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:31:18.900000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Revolves around the love between an immortal hero and Jana\u00e8na, the woman he has been in love with for 600 years, through Brazil's colonization, slavery, military regime and the future, in 2096, in the midst of wars for water.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0MzAyODM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA1MTA4OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1365120000000, "runtime": 98, "title": "Rio 2096: A Story of Love and Fury", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442338251000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 67, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Luiz Bolognesi"], "year": 2013}
