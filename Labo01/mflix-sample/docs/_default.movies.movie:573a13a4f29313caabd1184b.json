All her father Gus wants is for her to get married to a nice Greek boy. But Toula is looking for more in life. Her mother convinces Gus to let her take some computer classes at college (making him think it's his idea). With those classes under her belt, she then takes over her aunt's travel agency (again making her father think it's his idea). She meets Ian Miller, a high school English teacher, WASP, and dreamboat she had made a fool of herself over at the restaurant; they date secretly for a while before her family finds out. Her father is livid over her dating a non-Greek. He has to learn to accept Ian; Ian has to learn to accept Toula's huge family, and Toula has to learn to accept herself.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 259446, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 91697}, "languages": ["English", "Greek"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 11:18:25.963000000", "metacritic": 62, "num_mflix_comments": 391, "plot": "A young Greek woman falls in love with a non-Greek and struggles to get her family to accept him while she comes to terms with her heritage and cultural identity.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcwOWU4NGEtYjUyMy00MDNlLThiN2MtYzFlMjk4Y2FhNjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1028246400000, "runtime": 95, "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$241.3M", "consensus": "Though it sometimes feels like a television sitcom, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is good-hearted, lovable, and delightfully eccentric, with a sharp script and lead performance from Nia Vardalos.", "critic": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 129, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1044921600000, "fresh": 98, "lastUpdated": 1442347770000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 31, "viewer": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 763768, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://movies.yahoo.com/greekwedding"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Nia Vardalos"], "year": 2002}
