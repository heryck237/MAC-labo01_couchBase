He's not too keen on the series, mostly because he's not sure how to tackle the subject. Then it dawns on him: if he was to pretend to all and sundry that he was Jewish, he could then experience the degree of racism and prejudice that exists and write his story from that perspective. It takes little time for him to experience bigotry. His anger at the way he is treated also affects his relationship with Kathy Lacy, his publisher's niece and the person who suggested the series in the first place.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 39416, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 9909}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:35:34.840000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A reporter pretends to be Jewish in order to cover a story on anti-Semitism, and personally discovers the true depths of bigotry and hatred.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTZhYWIxNmMtYzE2OS00YzljLWI2YTQtZTE0NDU5ZDQwZTc0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -691632000000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Gentleman's Agreement", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "It occasionally fails to live up to its subject matter -- and is perhaps an 'important' film more than a 'great' one -- but the performances from Gregory Peck and Dorothy McGuire are superb.", "critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 36, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 952387200000, "fresh": 28, "lastUpdated": 1441046293000, "production": "Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 5415, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Laura Z.
