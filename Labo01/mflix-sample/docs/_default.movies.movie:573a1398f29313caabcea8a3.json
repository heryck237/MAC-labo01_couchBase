So she accepts the proposal of a nice, middle-aged fellow named Johnny Cammareri. Loretta is convinced her first marriage was cursed because she and her husband had gotten married at City Hall; this time, she's determined to do things right, even as she admits to her mother, Rose, that she's not really in love with Johnny. (To which Rose replies: \"Good. When you love them, they drive you crazy, 'cause they know they can.\" Rose speaks from rueful experience; she suspects, with good reason, that her husband, Cosmo, is cheating on her.) Loretta is convinced that marrying Johnny is the safe and sure thing to do - until she meets his estranged younger brother Ronny, who tends the ovens in a neighborhood bakery. Loretta discovers that in startling contrast to the pleasant, mild-mannered Johnny, Ronny is moody and passionate; what follow are complications worthy of a comic opera.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 93565, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 33067}, "languages": ["English", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:46:47.670000000", "metacritic": 83, "plot": "Loretta Castorini, a book keeper from Brooklyn, New York, finds herself in a difficult situation when she falls for the brother of the man she agreed to marry (the best friend of her late husband who died seven years previously).", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMDY0NzYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5NDk0NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 569203200000, "runtime": 102, "title": "Moonstruck", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Led by energetic performances from Nicolas Cage and Cher, Moonstruck is an exuberantly funny tribute to love and one of the decade's most appealing comedies.", "critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 50, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 899164800000, "fresh": 46, "lastUpdated": 1442167397000, "production": "MGM Home Entertainment", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 44091, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Patrick Shanley"], "year": 1987}
