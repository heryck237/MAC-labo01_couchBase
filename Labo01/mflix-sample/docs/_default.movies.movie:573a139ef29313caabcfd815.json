Their conversations (always revealing, sometimes revolting, and occasionally riotous) revolve around the weekend past and the girls that these three egotistical and narcissistic swingers were able or unable to \"scam.\" However, when all three single guys unknowingly go after the same \"perfect\" woman, Mia (Amanda Peet), they begin to question their skirt-chasing ways. Squabbling breaks out amongst the group as they compete for her attention and suddenly, the fate of their ritual and their friendships, becomes uncertain. Who will win the morning round table bragging rights? You'll be surprised.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 174336, "rating": 4.4, "votes": 3637}, "languages": ["English", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:50:54.623000000", "metacritic": 10, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Three egotistical swingers, who think they're God's gift to women, end up having their friendships tested when all three of them pick up and start dating the same woman.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNiMjFmZTQtMmQzNi00NGY4LWEyYmYtMzA0MDA4MWJkYTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 967766400000, "runtime": 82, "title": "Whipped", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$3.8M", "consensus": "The sex jokes in Whipped are tiresomely vulgar and unfunny.
