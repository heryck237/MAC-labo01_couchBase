Ricky (Michelle Hendley) is a 21-year-old trans girl living in Kentucky. Her only real friend, straight-laced Robby, has been her trusty, totally platonic, confidant for over 15 years. Her day job slinging lattes is merely a stepping-stone toward her goal of being a famous New York designer. She's confident, cool, and completely ready for something new-and then her world is transformed when an enchanting debutante saunters into her life. Triggering fresh feelings and experiences, this unlikely connection conjures up intense questions about identity while uncovering ghosts from Ricky's past. Indie-film veteran Eric Schaeffer (My Life's in Turnaround, If Lucy Fell) builds a compelling, compassionate world that focuses on the emotions and messy challenges of complex people navigating complicated relationships. Schaeffer creates a thoroughly authentic small-town atmosphere, capturing the cozy and claustrophobic ambiance of a place where everyone knows your name-and your sexual partners.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 3007302, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1812}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:26:26.187000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Boy Meets Girl is a funny, tender, sex positive romantic comedy that explores what it means to be a real man or woman, and how important it is to live a courageous life not letting fear stand in the way of going after your dreams.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MDkxNjg5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxODMyNTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1423180800000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Boy Meets Girl", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$20.3k", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1430092800000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1442263196000, "production": "Wolfe Releasing", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 692, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.boymeetsgirlmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Eric Schaeffer"], "year": 2014}
