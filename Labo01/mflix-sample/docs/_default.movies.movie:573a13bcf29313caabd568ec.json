Her German cousin Albert is encouraged to court her for solely political motives but, following her accession at age eighteen, finds he is falling for her and is dismayed at her reliance on trusty Prime Minister Melbourne. Victoria is impressed by Albert's philanthropy which is akin to her own desire to help her subjects. However her loyalty to Melbourne, perceived as a self-seeker, almost causes a constitutional crisis and it is Albert who helps restore her self-confidence. She proposes and they marry, Albert proving himself not only a devoted spouse, prepared to take an assassin's bullet for her, but an agent of much-needed reform, finally endorsed by an admiring Melbourne.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 962736, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 40030}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:07:39.447000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 5, "plot": "A dramatization of the turbulent first years of Queen Victoria's rule, and her enduring romance with Prince Albert.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MjExMDk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU3OTMwMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1262908800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Young Victoria", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$10.9M", "consensus": "Emily Blunt shines as Victoria in this romantic but plodding royal portrait.", "critic": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 145, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1271721600000, "fresh": 110, "lastUpdated": 1442166774000, "production": "Apparition", "rotten": 35, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 164201, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.theyoungvictoria.co.uk"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Julian Fellowes"], "year": 2009}
