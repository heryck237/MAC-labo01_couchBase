In his teens, Orton is befriended by the older, more reserved Kenneth Halliwell, and while the two begin a relationship, it's fairly obvious that it's not all about sex. Orton loves the dangers of bath-houses and liaisons in public restrooms; Halliwell, not as charming or attractive as Orton, doesn't fare so well in those environs. While both long to become writers, it is Orton who achieves fame - his plays \"Entertaining Mr. Sloane\" and \"Loot\" become huge hits in London of the sixties, and he's even commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. But Orton's success takes him farther from Halliwell, whose response ended both his life and the life of the up-and-coming playwright.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 93776, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 4186}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:34:28.517000000", "plot": "This film is the story of the spectacular life and violent death of British playwright Joe Orton.
