Eleven months later, having pled guilty to one count, he fled to Europe before sentencing. This film examines that year-long period, using archival footage of the media frenzy and of Polanski's life before the charges, clips from his films, and contemporary interviews with many of the principles - attorneys, the victim, and Polanski's friends and associates. Polanski remains enigmatic, but portraits emerge of the machinations of justice and of a judge more interested in his image than his word or the law.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1157705, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 4039}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:39:18.617000000", "metacritic": 78, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Examines the public scandal and private tragedy which led to legendary filmmaker Roman Polanski's sudden flight from the United States.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDA4MDk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE4ODg3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1228953600000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A courtroom drama and an exploration of celebrity and responsibility.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 47, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1233014400000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1440612692000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 3135, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joe Bini", "P.G.
