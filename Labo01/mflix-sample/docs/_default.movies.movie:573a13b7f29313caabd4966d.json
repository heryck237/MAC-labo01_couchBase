Enter \"The Life Of Reilly\". The clich\u00e8 goes that truth is stranger than fiction. In this case, it is also funnier and more heartbreaking. Charles Nelson Reilly, famous for his game show innuendos and \"X Files\" guest appearances, takes us through his bizarre, star-studded, tragic, hilarious, and ultimately amazing life with a potent blend of tenderness and quick one-liners. \"The Life Of Reilly\" is an adaptation of Mr. Reilly's acclaimed one-man show and was photographed for the screen during Mr. Reilly's final two performances of his play in North Hollywood, California.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 498366, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 275}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-02 01:23:09.417000000", "metacritic": 72, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "If, in 1940, you had a lobotomized aunt, an institutionalized father, a racist mother, and were the only gay kid on the block, what do you think the odds would be that you'd end up a Tony ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM1Njc5Mzg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2MTU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1142121600000, "runtime": 84, "title": "The Life of Reilly", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1416966642000, "viewer": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 106, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Linke", "Charles Nelson Reilly"], "year": 2006}
