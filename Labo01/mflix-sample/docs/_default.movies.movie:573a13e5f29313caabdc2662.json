THE GALAPAGOS AFFAIR is a gripping tale of idealistic dreams gone awry, set in the brutal yet alluring landscape of the Galapagos Islands. Featuring voice-over performances by Cate Blanchett, Diane Kruger, Connie Nielsen, Sebastian Koch, Thomas Kretschmann, Gustaf Skarsgard and Josh Radnor, this film skillfully interweaves an unsolved 1930s murder mystery with stories of present day Galapagos pioneers (a handful of Europeans, Americans and Ecuadoreans who settled idiosyncratically on the Islands between the 1930s and 1960s). As such, it is a parable about the search for paradise -- about what happens when a handful of individualists settle on the same small island seeking their own distinct and sometimes clashing notions of Eden.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 2960450, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 667}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:16:51.117000000", "metacritic": 67, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "About a series of unsolved disappearances on the Galapagos Island of Floreana in the 1930s.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI3Njc3MDA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY2NDMwMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1406246400000, "runtime": 120, "title": "The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.2M", "consensus": "It doesn't quite live up to its marvelously lurid premise, but The Galapagos Affair is still stranger than fiction in a very entertaining way.", "critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 49, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1410220800000, "fresh": 40, "lastUpdated": 1442168364000, "production": "Zeitgeist Films", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 1619, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.galapagosaffair.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dayna Goldfine", "Daniel Geller", "Celeste Schaefer Snyder", "Dore Strauch (from the books", " journals", " articles and letters of)", "Margret Wittmer (from the books", " journals", " articles and letters of)", "Friedrich Ritter (from the books", " journals", " articles and letters of)", "Hinz Wittmer (from the books", " journals", " articles and letters of)", "John Garth (from the books", " journals", " articles and letters of)"], "year": 2013}
