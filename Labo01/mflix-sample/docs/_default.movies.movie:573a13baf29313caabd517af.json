She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorc\u00e8es looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 865559, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 13624}, "languages": ["English", "Greek"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:45:49.713000000", "metacritic": 34, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A travel guide rediscovers her romantic side on a trip around Greece.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MzQ2NzczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyNDgzMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1244160000000, "runtime": 95, "title": "My Life in Ruins", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$8.5M", "consensus": "With stereotypical characters and a shopworn plot, My Life in Ruins is a charmless romantic comedy.", "critic": {"meter": 9, "numReviews": 121, "rating": 3.6}, "dvd": 1254787200000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1440527111000, "production": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "rotten": 110, "viewer": {"meter": 44, "numReviews": 280066, "rating": 2.6}, "website": "http://www.foxsearchlight.com/mylifeinruins/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mike Reiss"], "year": 2009}
