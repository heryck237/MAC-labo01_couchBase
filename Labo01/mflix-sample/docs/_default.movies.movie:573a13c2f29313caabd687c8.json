The drumming set pieces correspond to an avant-garde score with four hilariously titled movements. Where the short involved the six drummers imaginatively using standard apartment furnishings as their instruments, the feature unleashes them on an unspecified city's civic and cultural institutions. Including an amusing backstory for each of the soberly dressed drummers as well as their nemesis, music-hating investigator Warnebring, the film creates a treat for the eyes and ears from the dull, repetitive sounds of everyday life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 1278449, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 6344}, "languages": ["Swedish", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 01:10:56.917000000", "metacritic": 72, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A tone-deaf cop works to track down a group of guerilla percussionists whose anarchic public performances are terrorizing the city.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMjk2MzM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUzMTc0Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1331251200000, "runtime": 102, "title": "Sound of Noise", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$24.4k", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 22, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1340668800000, "fresh": 19, "lastUpdated": 1441303247000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 2106, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/soundofnoise?ref=ts"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ola Simonsson (screenplay)", "Johannes Stj\u00e8rne Nilsson (screenplay)", "Ola Simonsson (story)", "Johannes Stj\u00e8rne Nilsson (story)", "Jim Birmant (story)"], "year": 2010}
