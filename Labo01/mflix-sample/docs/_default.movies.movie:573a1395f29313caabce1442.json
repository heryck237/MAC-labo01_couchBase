U.S. Senators Hubert Humphrey and John Kennedy seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President. Wisconsin's primary - one of the few direct primaries at the time - is on April 5. We see both candidates on the road; it's retail politics, shaking hands, signing autographs, smiling. We hear part of a standard stump speech from Kennedy; we watch Humphrey talk to farmers in a rural hall. Kennedy is favored. We see his wife, his brother Robert briefly, and on election night his sisters Pat and Eunice. Jacqueline speaks a few words of Polish at a Milwaukee rally. The returns come in; it's on to Indiana and West Virginia.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 54205, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 545}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-13 00:03:53.113000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Cinema verite feature that follows presidential hopefuls John F.
