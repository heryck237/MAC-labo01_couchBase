So are Wendy, Isabelle and Martine. At forty you are supposed to be more mature and live a a steadier life than at twenty. But not Xavier. Well, to be fair, he has made some progress in the field of thoughtfulness (he has even become a writer) but as concerns his everyday life, it is far from well-ordered. To be totally honest it is not entirely Xavier's fault if his wife Wendy has suddenly left him for a new companion in New York and taken their two children with her. Realizing he can't stand living without them, Xavier decides to settle down in Big Apple in order to remain close to them. He finds a home in Chinatown and it does not take long before trouble comes his way.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1937118, "rating": 7, "votes": 8393}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Spanish", "Chinese", "Yiddish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:56:21.687000000", "metacritic": 64, "plot": "A 40-year-old father's life is complicated when the mother of his two children moves to New York.
