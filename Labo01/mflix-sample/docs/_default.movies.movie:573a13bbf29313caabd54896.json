It follows a witty, wisecracking, action-oriented sportswriter who, in the wake of his wife's death, finds himself in a sudden, stultifying state of single parenthood. Joe Warr throws himself into the only child-rearing philosophy he thinks has a shot at bringing joy back into their lives: \"just says yes.\" Raising two boys - a curious six year-old and a rebel teen from a previous marriage -- in a household devoid of feminine influence, and with a lack of rules, life becomes exuberant, instinctual, reckless... and on the constant verge of disaster. The three multi-generational boys of the Warr household, father and sons alike, must each find their own way, however tenuous, to grow up.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 926380, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 8227}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:06:43.337000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A sports writer becomes a single parent in tragic circumstances.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMTQ1MjczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg5MTI4Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1257984000000, "runtime": 104, "title": "The Boys Are Back", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.8M", "consensus": "Great performances by Clive Owen and The Boys save this melodrama from entering into the sappy territory it might have in less competent hands.", "critic": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 119, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1264464000000, "fresh": 85, "lastUpdated": 1441131595000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 34, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 21848, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.boysarebackmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Simon Carr (novel)", "Allan Cubitt (adaptation)"], "year": 2009}
