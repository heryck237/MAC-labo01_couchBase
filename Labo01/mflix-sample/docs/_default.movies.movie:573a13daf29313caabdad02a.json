Acclaimed author Jonathan Franzen, an idiosyncratic trombone technician, a charming fashion-averse teenager, and a bird-tour leader who's recorded every sighting she's made since the 1940s are among the film's cast of characters. Featuring spectacular wildlife footage capturing the changing seasons, this lyrical documentary transports the viewer to a dazzling world that goes all but unnoticed by the 38 million people who visit America's most famous park each year.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 2310157, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 244}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 09:47:09.843000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A diverse group of full-of-attitude New Yorkers reveals how a hidden world of beautiful wild birds in the middle of Manhattan has upended and magically transformed their lives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDYwNDU5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2NzMxOA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1331424000000, "title": "Birders: The Central Park Effect", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 1364169600000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1442509993000, "production": "Music Box Films", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 334, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.centralparkbirdfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeffrey Kimball"], "year": 2012}
