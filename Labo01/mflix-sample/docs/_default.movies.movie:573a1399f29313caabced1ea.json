Since, puzzlingly, the younger of the two boys is the only individual who can control the horse, ownership falls to him and his older brother by default. There being no place for the animal, they move him into the apartment of their alcoholic Traveller father. Police remove him and, in a shady deal, he ends up under control of a wealthy, underhanded horse breeder. The boys manage to retrieve him and escape on his back, but the stallion seems to have his own travelling agenda.", "genres": ["Family", "Adventure"], "imdb": {"id": 104522, "rating": 7, "votes": 2084}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 00:20:40.460000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Grandpa Ward gives a horse he found to his grandchildren, who keep it in their tower-block flat in Dublin.
