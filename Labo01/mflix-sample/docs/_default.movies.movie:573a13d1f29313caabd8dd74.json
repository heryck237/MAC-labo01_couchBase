We'll follow Mr. Xtreme on his nightly patrols through the streets of San Diego, as he tries to stop evildoers and protect the innocent. We'll also meet the New York Initiative, a fantastic foursome of real life superheroes living together that tackle crime fighting, one Brooklyn borough at a time. Lead by Zimmer, we'll watch as they take to the streets and try to lure criminals out of hiding with their controversial Bait-Patrols. With over 300 registered superheroes in the United States, we'll definitively uncover the 'Real-Life Superhero' cultural phenomenon and discover what inspired these everyday citizens to take the law in to their own hands as they try to make the world a better and safer place for all.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Action", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1792621, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 1510}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 18:02:24.660000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A journey inside the world of real life caped crusaders.
