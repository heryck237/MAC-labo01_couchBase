In a town near Little Rock, Lucy Fowler works hard for a construction firm; on weekends she drinks, goes home with someone, and come early morning, wakes and leaves as fast as she can. She cares a lot about her father, newly back in town, a painfully shy man who has nothing to say to her. She does go to a Holy Roller church with him about the same time that she starts, fitfully, a relationship with Cal Percell, new in town and a good guy. She kisses him sober, but still has demons to confront. What's the source of her careless ways; can she turn coal into a diamond?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 457308, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 2277}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 01:16:31.477000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A 30-something southern woman searches for love, despite the burdens she carries with her.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMDc0NjI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTExMjA0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1188518400000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Come Early Morning", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$50.2k", "consensus": "A quiet but moving film anchored by the unexpected depth of Ashley Judd's performance.", "critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 48, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1174348800000, "fresh": 40, "lastUpdated": 1438109791000, "production": "IDP Distribution", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 4679, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.comeearlymorningthefilm.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joey Lauren Adams"], "year": 2006}
