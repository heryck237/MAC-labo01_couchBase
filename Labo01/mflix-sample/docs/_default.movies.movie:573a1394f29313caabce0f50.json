Each woman has an intolerable daughter, though Annie's little girl Sarah Jane, is by far the worse. Neurotic and obnoxious, Sarah Jane doesn't like being black; since she's light-skinned (her father was practically white), she spends the rest of the film passing as white, much to her mother's heartache and shame. Lora, meanwhile, virtually ignores her own daughter in a single-minded quest for stardom.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 52918, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 10176}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:50:37.490000000", "plot": "A struggling young actress with a six-year-old daughter sets up housekeeping with a homeless black widow and her light-skinned eight-year-old daughter who rejects her mother by trying to pass for white.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhiYzRiMzMtODMwZS00OWIwLTk3NTgtYjI1MDMxMDU5OWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -336873600000, "runtime": 125, "title": "Imitation of Life", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1041897600000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1440526369000, "production": "Universal Studios", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 9417, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Eleanore Griffin (screenplay)", "Allan Scott (screenplay)", "Fannie Hurst (novel)"], "year": 1959}
