Charlie Gigot is a mute super at a dingy New York apartment building; he always wears a wool cap. One winter, a woman leaves her daughter Lou with Gigot, promising to be back the next day. Mom flakes out, and Gigot - who's down and out, probably with post-traumatic stress syndrome, has a drinking problem, and lives in a basement junk heap with a pet monkey - tries to find someone who will take Lou in. Winter gives way to spring; Gigot reluctantly becomes, in fits and starts, a parent. What if Lou's mom doesn't return; what are Charlie's options? His past may hold an answer.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 377972, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 953}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 07:56:10.507000000", "plot": "The mute superintendent of a ramshackle apartment building, becomes the unwilling guardian of a little girl with an attitude.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NDMzNTQ0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMxNjcyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1100995200000, "runtime": 103, "title": "The Wool Cap", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jackie Gleason (story)", "William H.
