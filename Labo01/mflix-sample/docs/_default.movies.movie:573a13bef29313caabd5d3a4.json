Ray has a side scheme going too, taking kickbacks on the love hotel project whose construction he's managing. The suburban Aussie marrieds live across a river from each other, the much older, domesticated Ray in a upper middle-class neighborhood, Carla on the wrong side of the water. The cheaters will lure their families to the same Christmas picnic celebration, to provide alibis while still being able to sneak off and chat about the arson. Carla's tow-truck owner hubby, Smithy, is a fearsome tough to cross, so will the philanderers' holiday gifts come through, or explode in their lying faces ?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1085507, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 4188}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:59:34.650000000", "metacritic": 75, "plot": "A man's life begins to unravel when his mistress brings him a bag of cash.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNDM1MTMwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMwMDYyMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1217462400000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Square", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.4M", "consensus": "The Square may not quite live up to the modern noir classics that inspired it, but with twists and tension to spare, it comes admirably close.", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 83, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1282608000000, "fresh": 71, "lastUpdated": 1441991214000, "production": "Apparition", "rotten": 12, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 3330, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.squarethemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joel Edgerton", "Matthew Dabner", "Joel Edgerton (original story)"], "year": 2008}
