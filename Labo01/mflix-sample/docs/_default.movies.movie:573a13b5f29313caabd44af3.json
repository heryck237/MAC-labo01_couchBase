Hank drives to Fort Rudd, New Mexico, to search. Within a day, the charred and dismembered body of his son is found on the outskirts of town. Deerfield pushes himself into the investigation, marked by jurisdictional antagonism between the Army and local police. Working mostly with a new detective, Emily Sanders, Hank seems to close in on what happened. Major smuggling? A drug deal gone awry? Credit card slips, some photographs, and video clips from Iraq may hold the key. If Hank gets to the truth, what will it tell him?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 478134, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 57436}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:15:46.487000000", "metacritic": 65, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A retired military investigator works with a police detective to uncover the truth behind his son's disappearance following his return from a tour of duty in Iraq.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODAxOTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYxODE1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1190937600000, "runtime": 121, "title": "In the Valley of Elah", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.6M", "consensus": "Though some of Paul Haggis's themes are heavy-handed, In the Valley of Elah is otherwise an engrossing murder mystery and antiwar statement, featuring a mesmerizing performance from Tommy Lee Jones.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 158, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1203379200000, "fresh": 115, "lastUpdated": 1440097324000, "production": "Warner Independent Pictures", "rotten": 43, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 28900, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.inthevalleyofelah.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Haggis (screenplay)", "Mark Boal (story)", "Paul Haggis (story)"], "year": 2007}
