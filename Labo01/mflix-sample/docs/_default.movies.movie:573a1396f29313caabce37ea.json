They are apolitical; a neighbor sometimes gives them a fish; wine is a luxury. They love each other, but there are problems: the war upsets Jan, he is weepy, too sensitive; Eva wants children, he does not. The war suddenly arrives: rebels attack, neighbors die. When the other side restores order, Jan and Eva are arrested as collaborators. After frightening and roughing them up, the local colonel releases them; then he begins appearing at their farmhouse: to talk or to pursue Eva? He gives her money. The rebels return; chaos ensues. Jan becomes violent and murderous; they flee. Can they escape? If so, to what?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 63611, "rating": 8, "votes": 7278}, "languages": ["Swedish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:10:56.233000000", "plot": "Ingmar Bergman's psychological study of how humans react in a situation of war.
