He also claims to be English in spite of his heavy Italian accent. Kurt is an habitual liar and a dangerous driver, at the very least. In the south of France he meets L\u00e8a, age 16. Between his increasingly strange dates with L\u00e8a, Kurt engages in a number of armed robberies, some successful, some not... The police are perplexed by a series of crimes including disappearances and a murder. They conclude that they are dealing with a madman... After he proposes, L\u00e8a breaks up with Kurt. The attempt to find a new girlfriend leads to a shooting by Kurt, now calling himself Andr\u00e8. L\u00e8a's information identifies Kurt/Andr\u00e8 as Roberto Succo, psychiatric patient and parental murderer. The police hunt for Roberto covers three countries.", "genres": ["Biography", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 234041, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 1024}, "languages": ["French", "Italian", "German", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-18 00:05:52.030000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the 80's Roberto Succo an Italian serial killer met a young girl in France.
