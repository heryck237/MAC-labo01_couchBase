As orphanage caretaker Harlan reads aloud about Northfork's years-ago forced evacuation to make way for a hydro-electric dam, Irwin's imagination takes flight. While a team of six men evacuate the last remaining citizens of the town, Irwin, too, invents a cast of characters to prepare himself for his own evacuation. (the above states the caretaker - who is actually the priest - is reading about a years-ago evacuation. In the movie, the evacuation is taking place as the boy lays dying!)", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 322659, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 4818}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:30:27.023000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Set in 1955, the residents of a small Montana community are forced to move their homes to make way for a new dam.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4ODE3ODEyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTYwOTk2._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1059696000000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Northfork", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.3M", "consensus": "Visually poetic, but may be too dramatically inert for some.", "critic": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 101, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1072742400000, "fresh": 57, "lastUpdated": 1442079363000, "production": "Paramount Classics", "rotten": 44, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 4713, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.paramountclassics.com/northfork"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Polish", "Michael Polish"], "year": 2003}
