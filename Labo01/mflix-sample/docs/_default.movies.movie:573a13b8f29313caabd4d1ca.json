When Derek discourages a youngster's hopes, he's sentenced to one week's hard labor as a real tooth fairy, complete with the requisite tutu, wings and magic wand.

But as Derek slowly adapts to his new position, he begins to rediscover his own forgotten dreams", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 808510, "rating": 5, "votes": 27366}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 01:00:51.930000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A bad deed on the part of a tough minor-league hockey player results in an unusual sentence: He must serve one week as a real-life tooth fairy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjQzMjQxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEzMDY4Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1264118400000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Tooth Fairy", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$58.6M", "consensus": "Dwayne Johnson brings the full force of his charm (and his appropriately pale chompers) to the title role, but flat direction and a committee-written script render The Tooth Fairy unacceptably dull.", "critic": {"meter": 18, "numReviews": 112, "rating": 4}, "dvd": 1272931200000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1442511810000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 92, "viewer": {"meter": 41, "numReviews": 183447, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.toothfairy-movie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lowell Ganz (screenplay)", "Babaloo Mandel (screenplay)", "Joshua Sternin (screenplay)", "Jennifer Ventimilia (screenplay)", "Randi Mayem Singer (screenplay)", "Jim Piddock (story)"], "year": 2010}
