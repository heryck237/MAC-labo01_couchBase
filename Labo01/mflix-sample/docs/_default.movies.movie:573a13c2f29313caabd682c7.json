They dream of leaving the squalor behind and moving into a life of prosperity and dignity. Though they look alike, the two are as different as chalk and cheese: one lisps while the other stammers; one is an honest, diligent social worker while the other hedges bets at a racecourse. The brothers want nothing to do with each other, but when Charlie gets mixed up in a deadly get-rich-quick scheme and Guddu realizes that the love of his life has unwittingly put a price on his head, their lives begin to collide. Faced with rogue politicians, drug dealers and crooked cops, they uncover a sinister plot laid out by the 'political-police-underworld' nexus. Their stories finally converge to a point when they realize they only have each other.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1274295, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 10941}, "languages": ["Hindi", "Marathi", "Bengali", "English", "Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 02:39:05.357000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The desperate lives of two estranged twin brothers converge over missing drugs, politics, racial prejudice, corrupt cops and an unplanned pregnancy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MTQ4NTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI3NTU2Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1250208000000, "runtime": 130, "title": "Kaminey: The Scoundrels", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1254182400000, "lastUpdated": 1442342161000, "production": "UTV Communications", "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 3508, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cajetan Boy (based on an idea by)", "Supratik Sen (screenplay)", "Abhishek Chaubey (screenplay)", "Sabrina Dhawan (screenplay)", "Vishal Bhardwaj (screenplay)", "Vishal Bhardwaj (dialogue)"], "year": 2009}
