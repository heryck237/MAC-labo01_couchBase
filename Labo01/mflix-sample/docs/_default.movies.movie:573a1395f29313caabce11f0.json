The story tells of a man's dilemma when he refused to participate in an unofficial strike, where he works. While vicious, calculated violence brings the other dissenters into line, he goes it alone and is sent to Coventry (given the silent treatment) by his fellow workers. A stirring, thought-provoking film that portrays the human problems and high emotions generated when a man dares to act on the courage of his convictions and dares fight to keep his individual freedom.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 53602, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 760}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:47:06.127000000", "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A young factory worker decides to stand up against his work-mates and fellow union members when they want to hold a wildcat strike.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzMjk4MzUtZWRhYS00NzkyLWJlOGItNmE4N2ZjYmYwOWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0MzMzNjA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -297475200000, "runtime": 95, "title": "The Angry Silence", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439665368000, "production": "Valiant Pictures", "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 130, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Richard Gregson (original treatment for the screen)", "Michael Craig (original treatment for the screen)", "Bryan Forbes"], "year": 1960}
