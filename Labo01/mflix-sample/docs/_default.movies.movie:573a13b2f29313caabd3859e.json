In addition to Chappelle, the roster of artists includes Kanye West, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, Dead Prez, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, the Roots, Cody ChesnuTT, Big Daddy Kane, and - reunited for their first performance in over seven years - the Fugees. Includes private rehearsals footage and Chappelle in the small Ohio town he calls home, where he wanders through town handing out golden tickets to invite several dozen citizens to join the party, providing transportation and lodging for their visit to Brooklyn. Ohio's Central State University marching band makes the trip and kicks off the festivities at the intersection of Quincy and Downing Streets. A diverse crowd and Chappelle's freestyle wit guides them (and us) through a celebration of music and comedy, history and community.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Comedy", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 425598, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 7523}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:13:16.187000000", "metacritic": 84, "plot": "A mix of Dave Chappelle's sketch comedy and musical interludes, inspired in part by the 1973 documentary Wattstax.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODAyNDM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ3NTIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1141344000000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Block Party", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$11.7M", "consensus": "Dave Chappelle's Block Party is a raucous return to the spotlight for the comic.
