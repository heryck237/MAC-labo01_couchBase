LAPD Patrol Officer Trey Sellars joined the force as a day job until his acting career took off.

Faced with a $10 million lawsuit, the department agrees to let producer Chase Renzi film Mitch's investigation for a new reality TV show, and constantly tries to make everything more \"viewer friendly\" by changing everything about Mitch's life to fit the stereotypical view of police officers--and partners him with Trey.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 284490, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 49772}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:50:43.917000000", "metacritic": 32, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A spoof of buddy cop movies where two very different cops are forced to team up on a new reality based T.V. cop show.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQzNGUyYzEtYzhlOC00YTQzLWJmOGYtOTNlMzE1Yjk4MDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1016150400000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Showtime", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$37.9M", "consensus": "Showtime starts out as a promising satire of the buddy cop genre.
