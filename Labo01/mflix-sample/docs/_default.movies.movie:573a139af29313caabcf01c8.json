One summer day, a boy of about ten appears on the streets of Nice - no family, no possessions, no schooling, but with a brilliant smile. Mondo's most at home in gardens, fields, and at the seashore. The bustle of the city can seem to overwhelm him. He has good survival instincts, running from police and from threatening adults, and he is looking for a family. Over time, people come to know him - he helps out a street magician, befriends an old man who keeps doves in his suitcase, and finds a mother, herself an outsider. That smile is always at hand. Yet, no vagabond child sits well with the authorities. Can Nice keep this treasure of the spirit?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 117076, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 403}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:00:50.167000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Mondo is a homeless young boy, with a big smile, who wanders around Nice looking for food and a place to sleep.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzA0ODQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMxOTcxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 864950400000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Mondo", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1130803200000, "lastUpdated": 1437159501000, "production": "WGBH Boston Video", "viewer": {"meter": 29, "numReviews": 91, "rating": 3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jean-Marie G.
