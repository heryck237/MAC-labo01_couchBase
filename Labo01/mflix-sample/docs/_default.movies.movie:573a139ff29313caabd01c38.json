Sharon Stone plays his unfaithful wife Candy. Tex catches Candy in the act and in a fit of rage he kills her. To conceal his crime he cuts up her body and buries it in the desert in New Mexico. However, when her hand surfaces, a blind woman trips over it and it restores her sight. The hand is then considered to be the \"hand of the Virgin.\" Despite the church's fallen priest objecting, the ambitious mayor of the town creates an international three-ring circus of miracle-seekers, TV crews, and born-again local prostitutes all interested in the hand. All of this goes on while Tex is desperately trying to recover the hand before the sheriff finds it and uses it as evidence against him.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 192455, "rating": 4.7, "votes": 2946}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:17:46.367000000", "plot": "A small New Mexican village discovers a severed hand that is considered a miracle of God, when it actually belongs to a murdered spouse with a husband in search of it.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmMzEyYjUtYTBiNi00ODgyLWFhY2YtZTdlNGQxNDAxNjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 967593600000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Picking Up the Pieces", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 990489600000, "lastUpdated": 1439835482000, "production": "Artisan Entertainment", "viewer": {"meter": 32, "numReviews": 2106, "rating": 2.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Wilson"], "year": 2000}
