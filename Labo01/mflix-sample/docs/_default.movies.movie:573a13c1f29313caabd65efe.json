Few words pass between them, and a past family tragedy brings sorrow daily. On a rainy night, Ey\u00e8p's boss Servet, a wealthy businessman who's entering politics, hits a pedestrian on a lonely road. He drives off and offers money to Ey\u00e8p if Ey\u00e8p will take the fall - probably a six-month sentence. Ey\u00e8p agrees, and while he's in prison, Ismail wants his mother to ask Servet for enough money to buy a car. Servet, in turn, desires Hacer.
