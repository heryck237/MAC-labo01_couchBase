He's living with his much younger wife Leocadia and their daughter Rosario. He continues to paint at night, and in flashbacks stirred by conversations with his daughter, by awful headaches, and by the befuddlement of age, he relives key times in his life, particularly his relationship with the Duchess of Alba, his discovery of how he wanted to paint (insight provided by Vel\u00e8zquez's work), and his lifelong celebration of the imagination. Throughout, his reveries become tableaux of his paintings.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 210717, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 1347}, "languages": ["Spanish", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 02:11:55.673000000", "metacritic": 61, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Francisco Goya (1746-1828), deaf and ill, lives the last years of his life in voluntary exile in Bordeaux, a Liberal protesting the oppressive rule of Ferdinand VII.
