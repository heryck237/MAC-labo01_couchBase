He is ridiculed behind his back by his subordinate NCO's and must play host to a liberal female MP making a tour of the base. However, when an ambitious African officer, who happens to be a protege of the MP's, initiates a coup d'etat against Captain Abraham, the lawful African commandant, the resourceful RSM uses all his military training to arm his men despite being under house arrest and rescue the wounded commandant from a certain firing squad. When Lt. Boniface, the leader of the mutiny surrounds the sergeants mess with two Bofors guns, it looks like Lauderdale will have to surrender unless he again disobeys orders and takes the initiative.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 58166, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 852}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:57:04.383000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An anachronistic martinet RSM on a remote Colonial African army caught in a local coup d'etat must use his experience to defend those in his care.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY4NTNhZjktNmNmZi00ZmVhLWE2ZGMtYzZjMjU5N2JkMzVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -163209600000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Guns at Batasi", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1148342400000, "lastUpdated": 1442428189000, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 147, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert Holles (screenplay)", "Robert Holles (novel)", "Leo Marks (original adaptation)", "Marshall Pugh (original adaptation)", "C.M.
