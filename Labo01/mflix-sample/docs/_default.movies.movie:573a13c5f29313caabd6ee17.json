His only companion is a series of self-help cassette tapes, one which describes the path to romantic love. He comes across a deserted broken down pickup truck, and further down the road the almost frozen dead body of its driver, Nathaniel Shoemaker, who he saves from dying. In their travels, the drifter learns directly from Nathan and through very descriptive letters of Nathan's that the drifter reads while Nathan is unconscious that Nathan is going to pick up his pen-pal girlfriend from prison, she who has given him the nickname NoDak. They have been corresponding for three years, during which time they have fallen in love despite not knowing what the other looks like. Largely due to his isolation and because of the cassette tapes which he has memorized, the drifter believes that he is better suited and more deserving of the girl than NoDak. The drifter makes it his mission to take NoDak's place in picking up the girl and ending his isolation as per what he's learned from the tapes. Their eventual encounter will show if theirs will indeed be a match made in self-help tape heaven.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1374996, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 122}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-23 00:12:54.527000000", "plot": "Three lost souls look for love on the North Dakota tundra.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwODk3MDE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5NDkyNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1293840000000, "title": "Prairie Love", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1352764800000, "lastUpdated": 1441910129000, "production": "Film Movement", "viewer": {"meter": 47, "numReviews": 23, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ashley Martin Bias", "Dusty Bias", "Holly Lynn Ellis"], "year": 2011}
