Madeleine the most unsettling creature of that name since \"Vertigo\" is a middle-aged, moderately successful actress. Oliver/Matthew is either a homeless man or a famous film director or both. Madeleine hails him on the street as the latter, launching a bizarre chain of events that includes a conversation in a diner, a very unromantic sexual encounter, the arrival of Madeleine's odd husband and unsuspecting daughter, and a child's birthday party. The film also compassionately tracks the daily rounds of Oliver/Matthew's fellow denizens of the homeless shelter, some of whom will be recognizable to New York audiences.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 120244, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 571}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:35:20.227000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "This film concerns two mysterious characters who meet on a Sunday in Queens.
