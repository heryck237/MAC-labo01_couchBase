Victorious general, Titus Andronicus, returns to Rome with hostages: Tamora queen of the Goths and her sons. He orders the eldest hewn to appease the Roman dead. He declines the proffered emperor's crown, nominating Saturninus, the last ruler's venal elder son. Saturninus, to spite his brother Bassianus, demands the hand of Lavinia, Titus's daughter. When Bassianus, Lavinia, and Titus's sons flee in protest, Titus stands against them and slays one of his own. Saturninus marries the honey-tongued Tamora, who vows vengeance against Titus. The ensuing maelstrom serves up tongues, hands, rape, adultery, racism, and Goth-meat pie. There's irony in which two sons survive.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 120866, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 16657}, "languages": ["English", "Latin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 03:10:51.800000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Titus returns victorious from war, only to plant the seeds of future turmoil for himself and his family.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE0ZWY5N2UtZTlmMy00NGIwLTg4MGItMzkzYTY5OTYyOWIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 950227200000, "runtime": 162, "title": "Titus", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The movie stretches too long to be entertaining despite a strong cast.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 75, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 966297600000, "fresh": 51, "lastUpdated": 1441994754000, "production": "Fox Searchlight", "rotten": 24, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 20375, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.clearblueskyfilms.com/films/titus"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Shakespeare (play)", "Julie Taymor (screenplay)"], "year": 1999}
