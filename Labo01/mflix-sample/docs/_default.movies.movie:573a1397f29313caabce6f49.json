Rondeau"], "fullplot": "Harry Williams, member of the rhythm & blues band, Bloodstone, is about to go onstage for a concert when he is hit on the head. The rest that follows is his dream. The four band members become conductors on a train filled with characters and (impersonated) actors from the 1930s, such as W.C. Fields, Dracula, and Scarlett O'Hara. Various songs are featured. The singing conductors are obliged to solve a mystery; Marlon Brando is murdering Nelson Eddy, Jeanette McDonald and others by suffocating them in his armpits. A wacky funeral, a fight with a gorilla, and the threat of being turned into a wax museum figure are all part of Harry's dream.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Musical", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 78412, "rating": 4.3, "votes": 66}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-27 00:03:29.180000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Harry Williams, member of the rhythm & blues band, Bloodstone, is about to go onstage for a concert when he is hit on the head.
