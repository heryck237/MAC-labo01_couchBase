Professor Tom Nesbitt, only witness to the beast's existence, is not believed, even when he identifies it as a \"rhedosaurus\" to paleontologist Thurgood Elson. All doubts disappear, however, when Elson is swallowed whole during an oceanic bathysphere excursion to search for the creature. Soon thereafter the rhedosaurus emerges from the sea and lays waste to Manhattan Island until Nesbitt comes up with a plan to try to stop the seemingly indestructible beast.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 45546, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 4311}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:12:25.313000000", "plot": "A ferocious dinosaur awakened by an Arctic atomic test terrorizes the North Atlantic and ultimately New York City.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM4MzNhMzMtNGU5Zi00MWJlLTgzYmEtY2RiM2Y5NGNmNzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -522374400000, "runtime": 80, "title": "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 16, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1066694400000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1440356448000, "production": "Warner Bros.
