Ben says sure, and they meet with the pastor, Rev. Frank. The only date open for two years is three weeks away, and Frank insists the kids go through his marriage prep course. They're to write their own vows; he also demands chastity, bugs their apartment, initiates arguments, has them care for robot twins, creates friction between Ben and her family, and raises doubts in Sadie. Desperate, Ben looks for dirt on Frank. Can he undermine Frank's authority and keep Sadie's heart?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 762114, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 30647}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 01:15:51.753000000", "metacritic": 25, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A reverend puts an engaged couple through a grueling marriage preparation course to see if they are meant to be married in his church.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MTM2MjQ5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3MDc0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1183420800000, "runtime": 91, "title": "License to Wed", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$43.7M", "consensus": "Featuring one of Robin Williams' most shtick-heavy performances, the broad and formulaic License to Wed wrings little out of its slightly creepy, unappealing premise.", "critic": {"meter": 7, "numReviews": 123, "rating": 3.1}, "dvd": 1193702400000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1442513090000, "production": "Warner Bros.
