When Veronica Franco comes of age, she cannot marry Marco Venier, whom she loves, because she is well born but penniless. Her choice: cloister or courtesan. She steels her heart, and with beauty and intelligence becomes the best. She's a heroine when she helps convince France to aid Venice in war with Turks, but when plague descends, the Church charges her with witchcraft. At her inquisition, she must match wits with an old rival, speak for all women, and call courage from Venier.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 118892, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 11707}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:26:05.737000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A Venetian courtesan becomes a hero to her city, but later becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzOTYyNDMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODgzOTE5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 887932800000, "runtime": 111, "title": "Dangerous Beauty", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 27, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 909446400000, "fresh": 19, "lastUpdated": 1441219160000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 9123, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Margaret Rosenthal (book)", "Jeannine Dominy"], "year": 1998}
