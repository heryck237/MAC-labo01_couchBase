Problem is, nobody loves a Bad Guy. But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun, Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan -- win a medal -- but soon wrecks everything, and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph's only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz, a young troublemaking \"glitch\" from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero before it's \"Game Over\" for the entire arcade?", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1772341, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 239680}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 00:48:41.443000000", "metacritic": 72, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A video game villain wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMxNTExOTkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEyNDc0OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1351814400000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Wreck-It Ralph", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$189.4M", "consensus": "Equally entertaining for both kids and parents old enough to catch the references, Wreck-It Ralph is a clever, colorful adventure built on familiar themes and joyful nostalgia.", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 168, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 1362441600000, "fresh": 145, "lastUpdated": 1442077698000, "production": "Walt Disney Pictures", "rotten": 23, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 235381, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/wreck-it-ralph/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Rich Moore (story)", "Phil Johnston (story)", "Jim Reardon (story)", "Phil Johnston (screenplay)", "Jennifer Lee (screenplay)", "John C.
