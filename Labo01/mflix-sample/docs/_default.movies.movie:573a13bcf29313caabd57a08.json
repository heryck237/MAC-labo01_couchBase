Sakharine has bribed the crew to revolt against the ship's master, drunken Captain Haddock, but Tintin, Snowy and Haddock escape, arriving in Morocco at the court of a sheikh, who also has a model of the Unicorn. Haddock tells Tintin that over three hundred years earlier his ancestor Sir Francis Haddock was forced to scuttle the original Unicorn when attacked by a piratical forebear of Sakharine but he managed to save his treasure and provide clues to its location in three separate scrolls, all of which were secreted in models of the Unicorn. Tintin and Sakharine have one each and the villain intends to use the glass-shattering top Cs of operatic soprano the Milanese Nightingale to secure the third. With aid from bumbling Interpol agents the Thompson Twins our boy hero, his dog and the captain must prevent Sakharine from obtaining all three scrolls to fulfil the prophesy that only the last of the Haddocks can discover the treasure's whereabouts.", "genres": ["Animation", "Action", "Adventure"], "imdb": {"id": 983193, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 165227}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:07:13.087000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Intrepid reporter Tintin and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship commanded by Haddock's ancestor.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE5MDExNTQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIxMTM5Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1324425600000, "runtime": 107, "title": "The Adventures of Tintin", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$77.6M", "consensus": "Drawing deep from the classic Raiders of the Lost Ark playbook, Steven Spielberg has crafted another spirited, thrilling adventure in the form of Tintin.", "critic": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 205, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1331596800000, "fresh": 153, "lastUpdated": 1442138288000, "production": "Paramount", "rotten": 52, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 76051, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.Us.Movie.Tintin.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steven Moffat (screenplay)", "Edgar Wright (screenplay)", "Joe Cornish (screenplay)", "Herg\u00e8 (comic book series \"The Adventures of Tintin\")"], "year": 2011}
