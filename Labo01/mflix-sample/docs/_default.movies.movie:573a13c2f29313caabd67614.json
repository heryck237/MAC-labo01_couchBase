Infamous for his bravado and outrageously daring prison escapes, Mesrine carried out numerous robberies, kidnappings and murders in a criminal career that spanned continents until he was shot dead in 1979 by France's notorious anti-gang unit. Thirty years after his death, his infamy lives on. Mesrine was helped along the way by beautiful and equally reckless Jeanne Schneider (C\u00e9cile de France), a Bonnie to match his Clyde. Mesrine made up his own epic, between romanticism and cruelty, flamboyance and tragedy.", "genres": ["Action", "Biography", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1259014, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 24657}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Arabic", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:35:31.553000000", "metacritic": 71, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of french gangster Jacques Mesrine, before he was called Public Enemy N\u00e81.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZhNWEwMDAtYzEyOC00NTVkLTgxZDktYjQwMDJiYjk2NmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAwMTU1MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1224633600000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Mesrine Part 1: Killer Instinct", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.6M", "consensus": "It's undeniably uneven, but Vincent Cassel's electrifying performance makes Mesrine: Killer Instinct a gangster biopic worth seeking out.", "critic": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 69, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1298332800000, "fresh": 56, "lastUpdated": 1440615843000, "production": "Music Box Films", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 20302, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.musicboxfilms.com/mesrine-killer-instinct"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jacques Mesrine (book)", "Abdel Raouf Dafri (scenario)", "Abdel Raouf Dafri (adaptation)", "Jean-Fran\u00e8ois Richet (adaptation)"], "year": 2008}
