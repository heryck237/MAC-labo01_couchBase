After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint. He tells stories of a woman on a blind date with a man who has testicles growing from his neck, in another a smitten woman offers her neck to her boyfriend to 'poop' on -as a sign of commitment and love. In yet another two parents take home-schooling to a whole new level of indecency, striving to give their isolated teenage son all the 'regular' torment and humiliation of puberty by bullying, peer-pressuring and even seducing him themselves. An off-beat, elephant-in-the-room type film.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1333125, "rating": 4.3, "votes": 72753}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:01:36.550000000", "metacritic": 18, "plot": "A series of interconnected short films follows a washed-up producer as he pitches insane story lines featuring some of the biggest stars in Hollywood.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NzQ3NDM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEzMjM3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1359072000000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Movie 43", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$8.8M", "consensus": "A star-studded turkey, Movie 43 is loaded with gleefully offensive and often scatological gags, but it's largely bereft of laughs.", "critic": {"meter": 4, "numReviews": 77, "rating": 2.2}, "dvd": 1371513600000, "fresh": 3, "lastUpdated": 1442336965000, "production": "Relativity Media", "rotten": 74, "viewer": {"meter": 24, "numReviews": 34755, "rating": 2.2}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/WhatIsMovie43"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Rocky Russo", "Jeremy Sosenko", "Ricky Blitt", "Rocky Russo (screenplay)", "Jeremy Sosenko (screenplay)", "Bill O'Malley (story)", "Will Graham", "Jack Kukoda", "Rocky Russo", "Jeremy Sosenko", "Matt Portenoy", "Rocky Russo (screenplay)", "Jeremy Sosenko (screenplay)", "Claes Kjellstrom (story)", "Jonas Wittenmark (story)", "Tobias Carlson (story)", "Will Carlough", "Jonathan van Tulleken", "Elizabeth Shapiro", "Patrik Forsberg", "Olle Sarri", "Jacob Fleisher", "Greg Pritikin", "Rocky Russo", "Jeremy Sosenko", "James Gunn"], "year": 2013}
