When the body of a murdered man washes up in Potsdam (within the Russian sector), Jake may be the only person who wants to solve the crime: U.S. personnel are busy finding Nazis to bring to trial, the Russians and the Americans are looking for German rocket scientists, and Lena has her own secrets.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 452624, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 20692}, "languages": ["English", "German", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:48:04.757000000", "metacritic": 49, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "While in post-war Berlin to cover the Potsdam Conference, an American military journalist is drawn into a murder investigation which involves his former mistress and his driver.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3ODEzNDMxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzExODkzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1169164800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Good German", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.9M", "consensus": "Though Steven Soderbergh succeeds in emulating the glossy look of 1940s noirs, The Good German ultimately ends up as a self-conscious exercise in style that forgets to develop compelling characters.", "critic": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 147, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1179792000000, "fresh": 48, "lastUpdated": 1441308576000, "production": "Warner Bros.
