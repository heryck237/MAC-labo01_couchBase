The resulting fire was not fought for over an hour although firefighters were on the scene with water cannons in place. Five children and six adults were killed and sixty-one homes were destroyed by the six-alarm blaze, one of the largest in the city's history. This dramatic tragedy unfolds through an extraordinary visual record previously withheld from the public. It is a graphic illustration of how prejudice, intolerance and fear can lead to unthinkable acts of violence.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 2119463, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 809}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-02 00:25:36.683000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A history of the conflict of the City of Philadelphia and the Black Liberation organization, MOVE, that led to the disastrously violent final confrontation in 1985.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE5NjkwMjE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI4NDgyMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1380672000000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Let the Fire Burn", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$59.0k", "consensus": "Smartly edited and heartbreakingly compelling, Let the Fire Burn uses archival footage to uncover a troubling -- and still deeply resonant -- chapter in American history.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 41, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 1395705600000, "fresh": 40, "lastUpdated": 1441993839000, "production": "Zeitgeist Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 755, "rating": 4.2}, "website": "http://www.letthefireburn.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2013}
