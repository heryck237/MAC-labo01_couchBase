We meet Mike's pregnant wife (whom he married out of high school) and watch Brian's search for a soul mate. There are internal squabbles within the ranks of the LAPD and lots of squad-car conversation. Can the lads escape the cartel's murderous reach?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1855199, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 165461}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:24:19.007000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Shot documentary-style, this film follows the daily grind of two young police officers in LA who are partners and friends, and what happens when they meet criminal forces greater than themselves.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNjU0ODU5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI4MzAyOA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1348185600000, "runtime": 109, "title": "End of Watch", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$41.0M", "consensus": "End of Watch has the energy, devotion to characters, and charismatic performances to overcome the familiar pitfalls of its genre and handheld format.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 169, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1358812800000, "fresh": 143, "lastUpdated": 1441994493000, "production": "Open Road Films", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 83189, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.endofwatchthefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Ayer"], "year": 2012}
