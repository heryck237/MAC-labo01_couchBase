He works at a Starbucks and is obsessed with the Beatles. He has a daughter with a homeless woman; she abandons them as soon as they leave the hospital. He names his daughter Lucy Diamond (after the Beatles song), and raises her. But as she reaches age 7 herself, Sam's limitations start to become a problem at school; she's intentionally holding back to avoid looking smarter than him. The authorities take her away, and Sam shames high-priced lawyer Rita Harrison into taking his case pro bono. In the process, he teaches her a great deal about love, and whether it's really all you need.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 277027, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 115379}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:21:04.047000000", "metacritic": 28, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A mentally handicapped man fights for custody of his 7-year-old daughter, and in the process teaches his cold hearted lawyer the value of love and family.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzEyNzc0NjctZjJiZC00MWI1LWJlOTMtYWZkZDAzNzQ0ZDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1011916800000, "runtime": 132, "title": "I Am Sam", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$40.3M", "consensus": "Not only does the manipulative I Am Sam oversimplify a complex issue, it drowns it in treacle.", "critic": {"meter": 34, "numReviews": 143, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 1024358400000, "fresh": 49, "lastUpdated": 1440181392000, "production": "New Line Cinema", "rotten": 94, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 300496, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.iamsammovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kristine Johnson", "Jessie Nelson"], "year": 2001}
