In 1779, a priest on his deathbed receives a young woman. Flash back 20 years: Marie-Loup, an herb-dispensing peasant, falls for Fran\u00e8ois, a man of property. The priest's perfidy and the treachery of a soldier separate the lovers and set in motion a chain of events leading to a death, a trial, and an execution. The action unfolds against a backdrop of England's take-over of French-Canada, the Church's manipulations to maintain spiritual hegemony, and the limited rights of woman and indigenous peoples. Watching it all is Marie-Loup's daughter, named France, who, when grown, is the dying priest's visitor in prelude and coda.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 386669, "rating": 5.4, "votes": 1034}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:37:20.090000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In the mid-18th Century, as England and France battle over control of Canada, an epic romance between a peasant woman and a trapper unfurls.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg4MjU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY2MzczMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1121817600000, "runtime": 143, "title": "Battle of the Brave", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Pierre Billon"], "year": 2004}
