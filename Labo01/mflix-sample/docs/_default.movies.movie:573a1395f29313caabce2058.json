An old lover of H\u00e8l\u00e8ne's comes to visit - Alphonse - with his niece Fran\u00e8oise; he too is back from Algiers, where he ran a caf\u00e8. Bernard speaks of his fianc\u00e8e, Muriel, whom H\u00e8l\u00e8ne has not met. The narrative, like memory and intention, is jumpy, the past obscured by guilt, misperceptions, and missed possibilities. Appearances deceive, things change. As H\u00e8l\u00e8ne and Alphonse try to sort out a renewal, everyone seems off-kilter just enough to hint that all cannot end well.
