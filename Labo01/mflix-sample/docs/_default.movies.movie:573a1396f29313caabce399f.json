Looking back on the trodden path, strewn with staunch determination and drab attitudes, Bhuvan Shome, a throughtly unenchanted man, seeks escape in a holiday. Off to duck shooting in Gujarat, Bhuvan Shome little ralises that the rejuvenation adventure would hurl him into a world so apart that he would find it the most joyful experience in his life. His new world consists of simple, uninitiated village folks, a bullock-cart drive, marauding buffalo and Gouri. In Gouri, Bhuvan Shome finds a fresh, throbbing pulse in a dying world. And suddenly everything lights up, perhaps heightening his sense of isolation, in his new found joy.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 64086, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 180}, "languages": ["Hindi", "Bengali", "Gujarati"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-22 01:55:46.677000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Bhuvan Shome is a lonely widower, a proud old man and a strict disciplinarian.
