From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 298228, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 32931}, "languages": ["English", "Maori"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:11:36.727000000", "metacritic": 79, "plot": "A contemporary story of love, rejection and triumph as a young Maori girl fights to fulfill a destiny her grandfather refuses to recognize.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3MzE2OTEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkyMTg4NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1062115200000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Whale Rider", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$20.7M", "consensus": "An empowering and uplifting movie, with a wonderful performance by Castle-Hughes.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 146, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 1067299200000, "fresh": 132, "lastUpdated": 1441993851000, "production": "Palm Pictures", "rotten": 14, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 49521, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.whaleriderthemovie.co.nz/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Niki Caro", "Witi Ihimaera (book)"], "year": 2002}
