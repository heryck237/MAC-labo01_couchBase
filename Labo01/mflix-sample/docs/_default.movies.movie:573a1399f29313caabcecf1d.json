During the investigation, Nick meets Catherine Tramell, a crime novelist who was Boz's girlfriend when he died. Catherine proves to be a very clever and manipulative woman, and though Nick is more or less convinced that she murdered Boz, he is unable to find any evidence. Later, when Nilsen, Nick's rival in the police, is killed, Nick suspects of Catherine's involvement in it. He then starts to play a dangerous lust-filled mind game with Catherine to nail her, but as their relationship progresses, the body count rises and contradicting evidences force Nick to start questioning his own suspicions about Catherine's guilt.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 103772, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 123620}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:13:03.960000000", "metacritic": 41, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A police detective is in charge of the investigation of a brutal murder, in which a beautiful and seductive woman could be involved.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk0YmJkNjItNDY3Mi00ZWFiLWEwY2EtMDJlZWJlOWZkNzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 701049600000, "runtime": 127, "title": "Basic Instinct", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, Basic Instinct contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot.", "critic": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 872553600000, "fresh": 32, "lastUpdated": 1442077428000, "production": "Artisan Entertainment", "rotten": 27, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 130981, "rating": 3.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joe Eszterhas"], "year": 1992}
