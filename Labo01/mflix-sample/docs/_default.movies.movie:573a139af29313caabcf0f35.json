He lives in a decrepit slum with his wheelchair-bound father, whom he treats quite badly. One day, a new family of neighbours move in, and the sexy younger daughter, Amparito, catches his eye, so he becomes a friend of Rafi, her nerdy brother, to get closer to her. At the same time, he discovers that a band of drug traffickers are operating in a nearby chinese restaurant; he knows that if he cracks this case, it could make him regain the status he lost within the police department; but the only people he can count on to help him are Rafi and his equally nerdy friends.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 120868, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 8407}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:14:57.960000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Jos\u00e8 Luis Torrente, a former policeman fights against the oriental mafia in Madrid.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWIyNmZmNWItZmExNS00MzA5LTk1ZTgtY2EyOTVlNWMzN2UwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 889747200000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440269560000, "production": "Doppleganger Releasing", "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 3450, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.TheTorrentePackage.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Santiago Segura"], "year": 1998}
