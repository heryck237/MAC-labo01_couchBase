To celebrate a life spent submerged in folk, Irving's loving son Jonathan has decided to put together a memorial concert featuring some of Steinbloom's best-loved musicians. There's Mitch and Mickey, who were the epitome of young love until their partnership was torn apart by heartbreak; classic troubadours The Folksmen, whose records were endlessly entertaining for anyone able to punch a hole in the center to play them; and The New Main Street Singers, the most meticulously color-coordinated neuftet ever to hit an amusement park. Now for one night only in New York City's Town Hall, these three groups will reunite and gather together to celebrate the music that almost made them famous.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 310281, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 21568}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-02 00:12:22.387000000", "metacritic": 81, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Mockumentary captures the reunion of 1960s folk trio the Folksmen as they prepare for a show at The Town Hall to memorialize a recently deceased concert promoter.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MDAwMTg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzg0MDI3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1052438400000, "runtime": 91, "title": "A Mighty Wind", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$17.5M", "consensus": "Though not as uproariously funny as Guest's previous movies, A Mighty Wind is also more heartfelt.", "critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 172, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1077062400000, "fresh": 151, "lastUpdated": 1441050812000, "production": "Castle Rock Entertainment", "rotten": 21, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 42332, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://amightywindonline.warnerbros.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Christopher Guest", "Eugene Levy"], "year": 2003}
