Home from the pub, he lies down; while his nagging wife Conchita looks on, he turns into a rat. She's chafed at how inconsiderate he is: hardly touching his food the next morning and leaving droppings on the good doilies. With curiosity seekers outside the flat and a writer at the door offering to help Conchita turn her story into a book, she calls a family meeting. Her seminary-bound son Pius wants to kill the rat; other family members are ambivalent. They opt to hurl Hubert over the fence of a maggot farm. Christmas approaches; an exorcism is in the cards, and the book becomes the Holy Grail. What of Hubert's conversion?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 234570, "rating": 6, "votes": 824}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-13 00:16:09.073000000", "plot": "A woman becomes furious when her husband arrives home from the local pub and turns into a rat.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU0NzQ4OTc5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNjAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 970790400000, "runtime": 89, "title": "Rat", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1003190400000, "lastUpdated": 1442341198000, "production": "Universal Focus", "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 335, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.rat-themovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Wesley Burrowes"], "year": 2000}
