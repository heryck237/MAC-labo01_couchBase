But his life is about to change when he delivers mail to his old schoolmate Noguchi, who's now a member of the Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia, and just finished cutting his little finger off. Sawaki stays only for a short time and Noguchi manages to smuggle a package full of drugs into Sawakis bag. And, like that's not enough, accidentally his separated finger falls into Sawakis bag too. Because Noguchi has been spied out for quite a while by the police, they think that Sawaki has something to do with his criminal schemings and decide to stick onto his feet. When Sawaki bonds with the fatally ill hit man Joe, it's clear for the police what he must be: A schizophrenic-paranoid, perverse drug dealer, murderer and even terrorist sent from the Yakuza!", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Action"], "imdb": {"id": 119926, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1323}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:38:35.490000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A postman is mistaken for a dangerous criminal by the police.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMWVmNTktYjBlMS00ZGJlLWE2NzItYTcyYmEzNzZiNWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ1MjYzOTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 871689600000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Postman Blues", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437418114000, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 596, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["SABU (story)", "SABU (screenplay)"], "year": 1997}
