They end up at an old country house near the town of Mortlake in Yorkshire. After they clean up the house so they can stay there they all head in to the village for some well earned drinks only to run in to the local \"town folk\". The next day they go to a place that has old train carriages to collect some scrap metal when they again run in to the locals, but this time it ends up with one of the youth workers being hurt badly. They go in to the village for help but it turns out to be the worst thing they could have done.
