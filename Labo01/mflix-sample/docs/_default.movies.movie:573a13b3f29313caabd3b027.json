Ondas is a herdsman, tough and strong. It's dry, dusty, and windy; too many lambs are stillborn. Against this backdrop, Asa, a dreamer who's slight of build and recently finished with a stint in the Russian Navy, tries to establish a life on the steppes. He, his friend Boni, and Ondas call on Tulpan, the only single girl in the area. The men talk to her parents while she listens out of sight. Her answer and Asa's later trips to talk to her form an arc of hope against the harsh land. Is this the place of Asa's dreams? What about the other lambs?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 436854, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 2485}, "languages": ["Kazakh", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 01:01:09.320000000", "metacritic": 88, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "On the steppes of Kazakhstan, Asa lives in a yurt with his sister Samal, her husband Ondas, and their three children.
