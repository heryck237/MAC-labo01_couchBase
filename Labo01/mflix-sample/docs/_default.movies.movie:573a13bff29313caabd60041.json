The businessman provides a bodyguard, Christophe, who is thorough and unsmiling. The middle-aged Beauvois is drawn to Audrey, in her 20s, free spirited, a local TV weather girl who once dated Christophe. Although Christophe warns Beauvois to stay away from Audrey, he's hooked and spends every moment with her he's not in court. What's her angle: is she a plant who'll ruin the case; is Beauvois her toy; is she digging for gold; or, is she genuine? Beauvois loves the wild sex but not her promiscuity. Has Christophe failed to protect him?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1139800, "rating": 5.8, "votes": 1591}, "languages": ["French", "Italian", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:49:39.923000000", "metacritic": 52, "plot": "Bertrand Beauvois, a well-known attorney, is in Monte Carlo to defend a businessman's mother who murdered a gigolo with ties to gangsters.
