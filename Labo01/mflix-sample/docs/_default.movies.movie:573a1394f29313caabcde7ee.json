He goes to town, posing as a merchant, explains his Australian accent, and learns that Maria Singleton, owner of a large ranch, and Rodney Ackroyd (who never explains where he got his name), another ranch owner and Miss Singleton's fianc\u00e8e, are the leaders of the cattlemen against the sheep-men. Romance tugs at Morgan and Miss Singleton, who quickly decides that Morgan has a much better name than Rodney (and other attributes) but the cattle-vs.-sheep feud keeps them apart. Until they meet in the street for a showdown gunfight following a disastrous clash between the cattle and sheep factions.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 42744, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 759}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:39:05.470000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An Australian sheepman comes to Montana looking for grazing space, is opposed by local ranchers and a wealthy cattle-woman.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEyNjI3MTQzMTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDExNjA5MDMx._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -628819200000, "runtime": 76, "title": "Montana", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1219708800000, "lastUpdated": 1440612015000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "viewer": {"meter": 30, "numReviews": 81, "rating": 2.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["James R.
