The others at the fort are two Indians, George and his sister, Martha, who came with the place, Chaplain Toffler, Reich, the soldier; Cleaves, a drugged-up cook; and Knox, who is frequently drunk. When a Scottish stranger named Colquhoun appears and recovers from frostbite almost instantly after being bathed, he tells a story about his party leader, Ives, eating members of the party to survive. As part of their duty, they must go up to the cave where this occurred to see if any have survived. Only Martha, Knox, and Cleaves stay behind. George warns that since Colquhoun admits to eating human flesh, he must be a Windigo, a ravenous cannibalistic creature.", "genres": ["Horror", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 129332, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 27768}, "languages": ["English", "Italian", "Spanish", "Washoe"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:30:55.257000000", "metacritic": 46, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Captain John Boyd's promotion stations him at a fort where a rescued man tells a disturbing tale of cannibalism.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JjMDJjMWMtMTI0OC00MzUxLWEwNTktZmRlY2M2YTYwNTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 921801600000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Ravenous", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 43, "numReviews": 46, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 1008633600000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1440095614000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 21142, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ted Griffin"], "year": 1999}
