Owlish Felix is an unpublished writer who vents his frustration by reporting to the super that the woman in a neighboring flat takes the occasional payment for sex. She's Doris, more wildcat than pussycat, and when Felix's peeping-tom-tattle-tale routine gets her bounced from her apartment, she knocks at his door at 3 AM, aggressive and ticked off.

Dancing by the light of the moon seems unlikely for this owl and pussycat.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 66195, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2194}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 01:15:59.820000000", "plot": "Can a bickering odd couple in Manhattan become friends and maybe more?
