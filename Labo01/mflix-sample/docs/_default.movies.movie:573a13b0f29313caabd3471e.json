Frank Keene, a grieving baker in a near catatonic state, happens on a car accident. The loquacious and insightful victim, Steve Mills, is on his way to an appointment in Pasadena with a years-ago acquaintance; he asks Frank to go in his place. It's a dance class. Frank goes, to find Steve's friend. The story moves back and forth among Steve's childhood, the scene of the accident, and the aftermath of Frank's first Lindy hop. Black eyes, group therapy, loneliness, boys being boys, roads not taken, and saying good-bye color the story.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 409034, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 2176}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 01:02:33.617000000", "metacritic": 40, "num_mflix_comments": 6, "plot": "A widowed man's life turns upside down when he embarks on a journey to find a dying man's long lost love.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDg0Njk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA4MDQzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1137024000000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.2M", "consensus": "Clumsily staged and brimming with melodrama and trite self-help cliches, this dance movie stays stuck at amateur level.", "critic": {"meter": 22, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 4.7}, "dvd": 1151971200000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1441905838000, "production": "Samuel Goldwyn Films", "rotten": 46, "viewer": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 4920, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.marilynhotchkissmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Randall Miller (short film \"Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School\")", "Randall Miller (screenplay)", "Jody Savin (screenplay)"], "year": 2005}
