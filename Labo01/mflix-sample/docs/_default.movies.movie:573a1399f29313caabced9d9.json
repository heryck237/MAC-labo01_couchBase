They have invited their friend and his wife Charlotte over for dinner, and are on pins and needles, as they want everything to go just right. Instead, George allows his bitterness that Charlotte, his ex-girlfriend, married a success to overwhelm him, and Martine and Jacques are apalled when their brother, who hasn't a penny and is deeply in debt, persuades their guest of honor to join him in a high-stakes poker game.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 106632, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 955}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:40:33.847000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Martine and Jacques knew their friend before he became an important television personality, but have not seen him for over ten years.
