Young men, most with spinal injuries, play this rough and tumble sport in special chairs, seated gladiators. We get to know several and their families. They talk frankly about their injuries, feelings in public, sex lives, competitiveness, and love of the game. There's also an angry former team member gone north to coach the Canadian team, tough on everyone, including his viola-playing son. We meet a recently injured man, in rehab, at times close to despair, finding possible joy in quad rugby. After Athens, the team meets young men injured in war: the future stars of Team USA.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 436613, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 8731}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:31:19.250000000", "metacritic": 87, "plot": "Quadriplegics, who play full-contact rugby in wheelchairs, overcome unimaginable obstacles to compete in the Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlYmM1MDUtODcxYi00NDFhLTg3ZmMtMjhkMTU3ZjM4ZmJhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1123200000000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Murderball", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.3M", "consensus": "An entertaining and gripping documentary that shows being confined to a wheelchair doesn't mean the fun has to end.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 138, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1133222400000, "fresh": 135, "lastUpdated": 1441914799000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 11213, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/films/murderball/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2005}
