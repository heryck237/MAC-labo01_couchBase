The film portrays the harsh existence of the homeless as Alex, Michele and Hans, an older vagrant survive on the streets with their wits. As they both slowly get their lives back together, Michele becomes increasingly dependent on Alex as her vision deteriorates further. Fearing that Michele will leave him if she receives a new medical treatment Alex attempts to keep Michele practically a prisoner. The streets, skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop to the story in a series of stunning visuals which dominate the film.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 101318, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 8070}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:37:47.610000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Alex, who's homeless and addicted to alcohol, and Mich\u00e8le, who's losing her sight, form a relationship while sleeping rough on Paris's Pont-Neuf bridge.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRlMzg3NjAtNzQzYi00ZTRlLTk0YzctNjVhMjM5MjA0NWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIyNzU0OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 930873600000, "runtime": 125, "title": "The Lovers on the Bridge", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 18, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1073952000000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1440443903000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 5523, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Leos Carax"], "year": 1991}
