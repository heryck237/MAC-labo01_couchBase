Gabrielle, his older sister, tells us of her brother's birth in Burma, childhood in Warwickshire, life at Cambridge and in London, then back to his parents' home in Tanworth. His parents describe his habits and personality. Two friends and the producer, arranger, sound engineer, and photographer for his three albums comment. His mother, a musician and poet, is an early influence. His quiet folk style made his one tour a disaster. His lack of success and gradual withdrawal end with his death at 26. Eleven of his recordings play on the soundtrack, usually as we see his room, a city, or the Warwickshire countryside.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 264013, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 517}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:38:52.967000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A study, mostly chronological, of the life of Nick Drake (1948-1974).
