Said falls in with a group of old men looking for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking. Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 246266, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 1872}, "languages": ["Persian", "Kurdish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:50:10.647000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Itinerant Kurdish teachers, carrying blackboards on their backs, look for students in the hills and villages of Iran, near the Iraqi border during the Iran-Iraq war.
