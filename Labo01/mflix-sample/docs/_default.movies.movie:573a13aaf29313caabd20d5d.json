Once in Moscow, they find he's polling at 6 percent with the election a few months away. While Dick Dresner wants to go home, George Gorton and Joe Shumate vote to stay. First, they must get someone's attention; they succeed finally with Yeltsin's daughter. Then it's polling, focus groups, messages and spin. Even as Yeltsin's numbers go up, the trio are unsure who hired them and whether Yeltsin's allies have a different plan in mind than election victory. When the going gets toughest, it's Gorton who puts a spin on our stake: democracy and capitalism must win.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 324619, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 861}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:02:31.747000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Russian political elite hires American consultants to help with President Yeltsin's re-election campaign when his approval rating is down to single digits.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4ODEwNjI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0MTcyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1066867200000, "runtime": 112, "title": "Spinning Boris", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1096329600000, "lastUpdated": 1439838243000, "production": "Showtime Networks Inc.", "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 112, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Yuri Zeltser", "Grace Cary Bickley"], "year": 2003}
