Cutler persuades Linda Kenney Baden to advise him. While the prosecution's story is contradicted by facts in the case, there is convincing circumstantial evidence against Spector, not the least of which is his appearance. As Baden gradually takes over the defense, even as she is ill with pneumonia, she must find a way to introduce ballistic evidence in a dramatic enough fashion to plant doubt in the jury's mind.

She coaches him and rehearses him: can he (and she) pull it off?", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1745862, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 4524}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:38:15.330000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A drama centered on the relationship between Phil Spector and defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden while the music business legend was on trial for the murder of Lana Clarkson.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NDI4MTc3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYyNTgxOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1364083200000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Phil Spector", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440098908000, "production": "Fancy Digital", "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.urumithefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Mamet"], "year": 2013}
