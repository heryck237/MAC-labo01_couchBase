For a young man, who has left his country behind, lost his memory and forgotten his love, the game might be the only way out. This is a story about a Bulgarian boy who grows up to be a German man. After a car accident Alex can't remember even what his name is. In an attempt to cure him from amnesia, his grandfather Bai Dan comes over to Germany and organizes a spiritual journey for his grandson back into his past, to the country where he came from. In changing places, time and transport, crossing half Europe, they play backgammon, the simplest, and yet the most complex of all games. That game leads Alex to the realizations of who he is, and that game is symbolic to the story. Destiny is the dice we hold in our own hands and life is a game on the edge between chance and skill.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1178197, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4546}, "languages": ["Bulgarian", "German", "Italian", "Slovenian", "English", "Hungarian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:28:20.233000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of Alex, who, with the help of his charismatic grandfather, Bai Dan, embarks on a journey in search of his real self.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5ODQwNzE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE0NjUxMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1223596800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The World is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1317600000000, "lastUpdated": 1439061168000, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 467, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Yurii Dachev (screenplay)", "Stephan Komandarev (screenplay)", "Dusan Milic (screenplay)", "Sabine Pochhammer (script consultant)", "Ilija Trojanow (novel)"], "year": 2008}
