Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young President/Co-owner of the team, Christina Pagniacci, now coming into her own after her father's death. Christina's driving desire to prove herself in a male dominated world is intensified by her focus on the marketing and business of football, in which all coaches and players are merely properties.", "genres": ["Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 146838, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 92931}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:36:07.207000000", "metacritic": 52, "plot": "A behind-the-scenes look at the life-and-death struggles of modern-day gladiators and those who lead them.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDk2YTQxZjUtYzJkYi00MTk4LTk4NDAtZmQ3ZGQwMDQxY2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 945820800000, "runtime": 162, "title": "Any Given Sunday", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Sometimes entertaining, but overall Any Given Sunday is a disappointment coming from Oliver Stone.", "critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 121, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 968112000000, "fresh": 61, "lastUpdated": 1442082393000, "production": "Warner Bros.
