She wishes something exciting would happen and knows exactly what they need: a visit from her sophisticated and much traveled uncle Charlie Oakley, her mother's younger brother. Imagine her delight when, out of the blue, they receive a telegram from uncle Charlie announcing that he is coming to visit them for awhile. Charlie Oakley creates quite a stir and charms the ladies club as well as the bank president where his brother-in-law works. Young Charlie begins to notice some odd behavior on his part, such as cutting out a story in the local paper about a man who marries and then murders rich widows. When two strangers appear asking questions about him, she begins to imagine the worse about her dearly beloved uncle Charlie.", "genres": ["Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 36342, "rating": 8, "votes": 42418}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 03:33:56.300000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A young woman discovers her visiting \"Uncle Charlie\" may not be the man he seems to be.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyOGE2Y2EtYzI2My00MDcxLWFmNzYtYjMzN2NiMmMzMzAzL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -850867200000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Shadow of a Doubt", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Alfred Hitchcock's earliest classic -- and his own personal favorite -- deals its flesh-crawling thrills as deftly as its finely shaded characters.", "critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 34, "rating": 9}, "dvd": 983836800000, "fresh": 34, "lastUpdated": 1440347055000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 18972, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thornton Wilder (screenplay)", "Sally Benson (screenplay)", "Alma Reville (screenplay)", "Gordon McDonell (from an original story by)"], "year": 1943}
