Angela Dodson who needs his help to prove that her twin sister Isabel's death was not a suicide. The dead woman was a devout Catholic and Angela refuses to accept she would have taken her own life. She's asked Constantine for help because he has a reputation for dealing with the mystical. In fact, he is a demon hunter whose sole purpose on Earth is to send demons back to the nether regions. John himself has been to Hell - as a young man he too committed suicide and now knows that he is destined to return there on his death - but hopes his good deeds may somehow find him a place in Heaven. As he looks into Isabel's death, he realises demons are trying to break through to the human world, and his battles lead him into a direct conflict with Satan.", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 360486, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 216603}, "languages": ["English", "Filipino", "Tagalog"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:28:12.443000000", "metacritic": 50, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Constantine tells the story of irreverent supernatural detective John Constantine, who has literally been to hell and back.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5NDk5NTUyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzUyMDA3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1108684800000, "runtime": 121, "title": "Constantine", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$75.5M", "consensus": "Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, Constantine lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, The Matrix.", "critic": {"meter": 46, "numReviews": 217, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 1121731200000, "fresh": 100, "lastUpdated": 1441908758000, "production": "Warner Bros.
