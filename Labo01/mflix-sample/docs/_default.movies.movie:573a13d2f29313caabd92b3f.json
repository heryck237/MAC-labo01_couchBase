Early in 2010, the camera is in the studio as John coaxes a nearly-burned-out Russell, recovering from brain surgery, into composing, playing, and singing. Neil Young, Brian Wilson, and Booker T. Jones come in for a day or two, recording tracks. T Bone Burnett produces. Archival footage shows the young rockers, Crowe interviews his stars, and there's a sound montage of hits on which Russell was a studio musician. By October, 2010, the CD \"The Union\" is ready for release; there's a concert in Boston. Friendship gets an encore.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1854364, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 102}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-14 00:37:40.537000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A look at the making of Elton John and Leon Russell's collaborative album, \"The Union,\" produced by T-Bone Burnett.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA1ODQyMDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIyMjkwNQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1325376000000, "title": "The Union", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439835411000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 17, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2011}
