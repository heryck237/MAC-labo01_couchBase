Only problem is, Sam's mother is still there, supposedly finishing up a record that she's producing for the band of her new boy toy, Ian. She seems more interested in smoking pot and drinking than actually working though. Alex doesn't mind but Sam is quite upset. Alex starts off focused on her work (finishing a dissertation on genomics), but is soon distracted by the rock-'n-roll lifestyle going on around her. Meanwhile, Sam is equally distracted by beautiful Israeli intern Sara.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 298408, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 12772}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:18:50.820000000", "metacritic": 61, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "When an uptight young man and his fiancee move into his libertine mother's house, the resulting clash of life attitudes shakes everyone up.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMjMxMDA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE5MTI3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1048809600000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Laurel Canyon", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$3.6M", "consensus": "Though the movie itself is flawed, McDormand is fantastic as Jane.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 110, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1058227200000, "fresh": 75, "lastUpdated": 1440442064000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 35, "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 9115, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/laurelcanyon"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lisa Cholodenko"], "year": 2002}
