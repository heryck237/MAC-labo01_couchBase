Jacob Hatley's extraordinarily intimate documentary finds Helm, a founding member of The Band, at home in Woodstock in the midst of creating his first studio album in 25 years. The ultimate survivor, he's overcome drugs, bankruptcy, the bitter breakup of The Band and a bout of throat cancer -but then, as the rueful title indicates, he wasn't in it for his health.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1362518, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 310}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:00:22.053000000", "metacritic": 76, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A documentary on Levon Helm, a founding member of The Band, at home in Woodstock in the midst of creating his first studio album in 25 years.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NjU0NzQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM0MjczOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1366329600000, "title": "Ain't in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$99.1k", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1381104000000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1442345085000, "production": "Kino Lorber", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 614, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.levonhelmfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2010}
