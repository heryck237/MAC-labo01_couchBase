He is Pigoil, the aging stage manager at Chansonia, a music hall in a Paris faubourg. His confession is a long flashback to New Year's Eve, 1935, when he discovers his wife is unfaithful and Galapiat, the local mobster, closes the music hall. Over the next few months, Pigoil loses custody of his beloved son, Jo-Jo, and must find work. Pigoil and his pals take over the Chansonia as a co-op; Galapiat is momentarily benign. Their star is the young Douce, a girl from near Lille for whom Galapiat lusts. She in turn falls in love with Milou, a local Red. There are ups and downs, but mostly ups - but what about Jo-Jo and what about the murder?", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 948535, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 2237}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:28:08.210000000", "metacritic": 40, "plot": "A man is charged with murder.
