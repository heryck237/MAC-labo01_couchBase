Raghu (Shushant Singh Rajput) needs a woman in his life -the rest he's going to figure out along the way. Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra) has been around the block a few times and knows the scene, warts and all. Tara (Vaani Kapoor) knows what's right for her, but a little experimenting never did hurt anybody, did it? When their lives crisscross, their beliefs get challenged, and their loves, tested.
