But through his Extreme Ice Survey, he discovers undeniable evidence of our changing planet. In 'Chasing Ice,' we follow Balog across the Arctic as he deploys revolutionary time-lapse cameras designed for one purpose: to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers. Balog's hauntingly beautiful videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. Traveling with a young team of adventurers by helicopter, canoe and dog sled across three continents, Balog risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story in human history. As the debate polarizes America and the intensity of natural disasters ramp up around the world, 'Chasing Ice' depicts a heroic photojournalist on a mission to gather evidence and deliver hope to our carbon-powered planet", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 1579361, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 5212}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:04:54.103000000", "metacritic": 75, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Follow National Geographic photographer James Balog across the Arctic as he deploys time-lapse cameras designed for one purpose: to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc0MzAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY1NzE3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1355443200000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Chasing Ice", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Monroe"], "year": 2012}
