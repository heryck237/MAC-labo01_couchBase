His life begins to change, however, when he finds out he's on academic probation, and when he stumbles into love with Miss Cross, a pretty teacher of the elementary school at Rushmore. Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume, wealthy industrialist and father to boys who attend the school, and who also finds himself attracted to Miss Cross. Max's fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle, and how he sets about resolving it is the story in the film.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 128445, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 124741}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "Latin", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:11:47.040000000", "metacritic": 86, "plot": "The extracurricular king of Rushmore preparatory school is put on academic probation.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2OTc3OTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg2NjIyMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 919382400000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Rushmore", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story, with fine, off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray.", "critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 102, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 930614400000, "fresh": 91, "lastUpdated": 1439835481000, "production": "Touchstone Pictures", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 184333, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Wes Anderson", "Owen Wilson"], "year": 1998}
