Support comes from his sister, a lab tech, the Hemlock Society president, and a lawyer. The child of survivors of the Armenian genocide interviews applicants: his sister video tapes them. He assembles a device allowing a person to initiate a three-chemical intravenous drip. The local D.A., the governor, and the Legislature respond. In court scenes, Kevorkian is sometimes antic. He's single-minded about giving dying individuals the right to determine how their lives will end. He wants the Supreme Court to rule. He picks a fight he can't win: is it hubris or heroism?", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1132623, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 20482}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:12:03.127000000", "plot": "A look at the life and work of doctor-assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MTYwODQwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQzNzI0Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1272067200000, "runtime": 134, "title": "You Don't Know Jack", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1288051200000, "lastUpdated": 1442435268000, "production": "HBO Films", "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 3649, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.hbo.com/movies/you-dont-know-jack/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Adam Mazer"], "year": 2010}
