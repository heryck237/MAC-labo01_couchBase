However with the US invasion of Iraq about to begin over frustrated worldwide objections about this needless war, one of the Chick vents off the cuff in concert about being ashamed of US President George W. Bush. This statement sparks a firestorm of organized and personal right wing attacks against the Chicks for daring to think they have the right to express a negative personal opinion about the President. This film covers the band's effort to ride out the turmoil that would leave their careers under a cloud, but would eventually give them a opportunity to grow as great artists who bow to no one.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 811136, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 4394}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:24:28.203000000", "metacritic": 77, "plot": "A documentary on the Dixie Chicks in the wake of singer Natalie Maines' anti-George W.
