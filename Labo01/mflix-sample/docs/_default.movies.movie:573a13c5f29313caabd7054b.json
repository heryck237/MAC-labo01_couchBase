Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1392170, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 640758}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:05:45.990000000", "metacritic": 67, "num_mflix_comments": 370, "plot": "Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDg3NzYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgyNzkyNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1332460800000, "runtime": 142, "title": "The Hunger Games", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$408.0M", "consensus": "Thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.", "critic": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 277, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1345248000000, "fresh": 233, "lastUpdated": 1442079209000, "production": "Lionsgate", "rotten": 44, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 897824, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://thehungergamesmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gary Ross (screenplay)", "Suzanne Collins (screenplay)", "Billy Ray (screenplay)", "Suzanne Collins (novel)"], "year": 2012}
