Two-thirds of the combatants die but the winner may earn his freedom. On the day he loses his job, steelworker Jensen Ames is arrested for his wife's murder. Sent to Terminal Island, he's offered an out by the steely and manipulative Warden Hennessey - race as the popular mask-wearing (but now dead) champion, Frankenstein, or rot in prison. Jensen makes the bargain. As the three-stage race approaches, he realizes that the whole thing may be a set up - can an anonymous man behind a mask get revenge and win his release?", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 452608, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 155544}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:01:55.330000000", "metacritic": 43, "plot": "Ex-con Jensen Ames is forced by the warden of a notorious prison to compete in our post-industrial world's most popular sport: a car race in which inmates must brutalize and kill one another on the road to victory.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMDU1ODg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMzNjY3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1219363200000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Death Race", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$36.1M", "consensus": "Mindless, violent, and lightning-paced, Death Race is little more than an empty action romp.", "critic": {"meter": 43, "numReviews": 150, "rating": 4.8}, "dvd": 1229817600000, "fresh": 64, "lastUpdated": 1442082631000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 86, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 207088, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.deathracemovie.net/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul W.S.
