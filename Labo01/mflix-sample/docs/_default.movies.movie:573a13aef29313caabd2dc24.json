In this documentary, Thom Andersen examines in detail the ways the city has been depicted, both when it is meant to be anonymous and when itself is the focus. Along the way, he illustrates his concerns of how the real city and its people are misrepresented and distorted through the prism of popular film culture. Furthermore, he also chronicles the real stories of the city's modern history behind the notorious accounts of the great conspiracies that ravaged his city that reveal a more open and yet darker past than the casual viewer would suspect.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 379357, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1256}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 01:49:43.667000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A documentary on how Los Angeles has been used and depicted in the movies.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMzMzMjEyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAxMDcyNjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1072915200000, "runtime": 169, "title": "Los Angeles Plays Itself", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thom Andersen (text)"], "year": 2003}
