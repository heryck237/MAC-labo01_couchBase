His family, which is a big one of the kind, gathers to celebrate him on a castle. Everybody likes and respects the father deeply...or do they? The youngest son is trying to live up to the father's expectations. He is running a grill-bar in a dirty part of Copenhagen. The oldest son runs a restaurant in France, while the sister is a anthropologist. The older sister has recently committed suicide and the father asks the oldest son to say a few words about her, because he is afraid he will break into tears if he does it himself. The oldest son agrees without argument. Actually he has already written two speeches. A yellow and a green one. By the table, he asks the father to pick a speech. The father chooses green. The oldest son announces that this is the Speech of Truth. Everybody laughs, except for the father who gets a nervous look on his face. For he knows that the oldest son is about to reveal the secret of why the oldest sister killed herself.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 154420, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 62593}, "languages": ["Danish", "German", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 17:30:29.507000000", "metacritic": 82, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "At Helge's 60th birthday party, some unpleasant family truths are revealed.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY0NWJiZjgtMTJjNi00YjQ1LTgzNWMtNmY3NTkyOTE4ZWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDEzMTI3MTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 898214400000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Celebration", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 39, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1113264000000, "fresh": 36, "lastUpdated": 1440439960000, "production": "October Films", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 20235, "rating": 4.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thomas Vinterberg (screenplay)", "Mogens Rukov (screenplay)", "Thomas Vinterberg (idea)"], "year": 1998}
