Most students goof off: drinking, partying, and focusing on sex. Eun-shik, a law student who's been in the military, is older but socially inept. He likes Eun-hyo; even though his earnest and simple side appeals to her, his juvenile excesses make him irrelevant when Sung-ok, a good-looking rich kid, charms Eun-hyo. They begin an affair, leaving Eun-shik on the sidelines. The national competition approaches and complications arise.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 341555, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 4801}, "languages": ["Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:17:59.923000000", "plot": "At Sunjong University, a few students are serious, including Eun-hyo, who works hard at aerobics in hopes of doing well in a national competition.
