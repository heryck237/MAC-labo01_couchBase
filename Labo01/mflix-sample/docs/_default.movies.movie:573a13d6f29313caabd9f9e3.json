She gets to know her latex and wooden travelling partners along the way, and with them deconstructs herself and her lost love in this ventriloquial docu-mocumentary requiem. Ken Campbell was a hugely respected maverick of the British Theatre, an eccentric genius who would snort out forgotten artforms. Nina was his prodigy in ventriloquism and has been said to have reinvented the artform. This film is truly unique in genre and style. No one has seen ventriloquism like this before.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 2081260, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 242}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 01:15:00.370000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Internationally acclaimed ventriloquist Nina Conti, takes the bereaved puppets of her mentor and erstwhile lover Ken Campbell on a pilgrimage to 'Venthaven' the resting place for puppets of...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMDk5NTU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUzNzczOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1391644800000, "runtime": 64, "title": "Her Master's Voice", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1348531200000, "lastUpdated": 1442436613000, "production": "Virgil Films", "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 64, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Nina Conti"], "year": 2012}
