Once there, he soon meets up with the new President, Idi Amin, who promises a golden age for the African nation. Garrigan hits it off immediately with the rabid Scotland fan, who soon offers him a senior position in the national health department and becomes one of Amin's closest advisers. However as the years pass, Garrigan cannot help but notice Amin's increasingly erratic behavior that grows beyond a legitimate fear of assassination into a murderous insanity that is driving Uganda into bloody ruin. Realizing his dire situation with the lunatic leader unwilling to let him go home, Garrigan must make some crucial decisions that could mean his death if the despot finds out.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 455590, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 135417}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German", "Swahili"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:26:53.863000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NTkxNjkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgwMDAxMzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1169164800000, "runtime": 123, "title": "The Last King of Scotland", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$17.4M", "consensus": "Forest Whitaker's performance as real-life megalomaniac dictator Idi Amin powers this fictionalized political thriller, a blunt and brutal tale about power and corruption.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 181, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1176768000000, "fresh": 157, "lastUpdated": 1442164018000, "production": "Fox Searchlight", "rotten": 24, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 256978, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thelastkingofscotland/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Peter Morgan (screenplay)", "Jeremy Brock (screenplay)", "Giles Foden (novel)"], "year": 2006}
