Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school. The affluent man lives a steady yet boring life. At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in. There live a crowd of lively Spanish maids who will help Jean-Louis to open to a new civilization and a new approach of life. In their company - and more precisely in the company of beautiful Maria - Jean-Louis will gradually become another man, a better man.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1805297, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 6904}, "languages": ["French", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:26:28.877000000", "metacritic": 52, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In 1960s Paris, a conservative couple's lives are turned upside down by two Spanish maids.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzY2OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM3NTIyNQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1317945600000, "runtime": 102, "title": "The Women on the 6th Floor", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.7M", "critic": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 65, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1331596800000, "fresh": 43, "lastUpdated": 1441136776000, "production": "Strand Releasing", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 1865, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.strandreleasing.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Philippe Le Guay", "J\u00e8r\u00e8me Tonnerre"], "year": 2010}
