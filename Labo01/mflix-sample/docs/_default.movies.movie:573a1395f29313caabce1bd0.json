The story opens with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle accident in Dorset at the age of 46, then flashbacks to recount his adventures: as a young intelligence officer in Cairo in 1916, he is given leave to investigate the progress of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I. In the desert, he organizes a guerrilla army and--for two years--leads the Arabs in harassing the Turks with desert raids, train-wrecking and camel attacks. Eventually, he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the Ottoman Empire.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 56172, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 172014}, "languages": ["English", "Arabic", "Turkish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:26:29.863000000", "metacritic": 100, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Follows a brilliant, flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during wartime service.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5ZjhjNGYtZmI2Ny00ODM0LWFkNzgtZmI1YzA2N2MxMzA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": -222825600000, "runtime": 216, "title": "Lawrence of Arabia", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The epic of all epics, Lawrence of Arabia cements director David Lean's status in the filmmaking pantheon with nearly four hours of grand scope, brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography.", "critic": {"meter": 99, "numReviews": 71, "rating": 9}, "dvd": 986256000000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1442167600000, "production": "Columbia Pictures", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 72216, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["T.E.
