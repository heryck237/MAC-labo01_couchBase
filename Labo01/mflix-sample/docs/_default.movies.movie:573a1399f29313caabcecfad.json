This atmosphere lends itself to repressed emotions - shown through the parallel stories of butler student Johann lusting after his mother (an old flame of the mysterious Count Knotkers) and Klara's attraction to her father (who lusts after his other daughter), leading to duels and suicidal plunges galore. All this is shot in the style of an early German sonal film, complete with intertitles, crackly sound-track and 'hand-tinted' colour effects.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 103926, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1350}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:02:17.613000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the Alpine village of Tolzbad in the 1800s, the townsfolk talk quietly and restrain their movements lest they incur avalanches.
