Green"], "fullplot": "Biopic of the famed British Prime Minister focusing on his concern about Russia's growing interest in the Indian subcontinent and his attempts to buy the Suez Canal. He sees the Canal as the key strategic resource in maintaining the Empire in the East but is unpopular in many quarters. With antisemitism rife at the time, Disraeli finds little support for his plan to purchase the canal or his foreign policy in general. There is no doubt that the Russians are plotting against British interests and he is surrounded by spies, even in his office at 10 Downing St. When the Bank of England refuses to finance the purchase of the available shares he turns to private sources to raise the available cash only to find the conspirators one step ahead of him.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 19823, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 694}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-21 08:18:53.010000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Prime Minister of Great Britain Benjamin Disraeli outwits the subterfuge of the Russians and chicanery at home in order to secure the purchase of the Suez Canal.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTAxOTExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk1MjgwMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -1267574400000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Disraeli", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1209427200000, "lastUpdated": 1441912147000, "production": "A & E", "viewer": {"meter": 0, "numReviews": 51, "rating": 2.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Julien Josephson (screen play)"], "year": 1929}
