But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1103153, "rating": 5.4, "votes": 68026}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:46:54.620000000", "metacritic": 21, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A vacationing woman meets her ideal man, leading to a swift marriage.
