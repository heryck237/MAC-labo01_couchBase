However, meeting the charming Barbara Spooner, Wilberforce finds a soulmate to share the story of his struggle. With few allies such as his mentor, John Newton, a slave ship captain turned repentant priest who penned the great hymn, \"Amazing Grace,\" Prime William Pitt, and Olaudah Equiano, the erudite former slave turned author, Wilberforce fruitlessly fights both public indifference and moneyed opposition determined to keep their exploitation safe. Nevertheless, Wilberforce finds the inspiration in newfound love to rejuvenate the fight with new ideas that would lead to a great victory for social justice.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 454776, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 19698}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:00:30.910000000", "metacritic": 65, "plot": "The idealist William Wilberforce maneuvers his way through Parliament, endeavoring to end the British transatlantic slave trade.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MTkxMDA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA4Mjg0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1172188800000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Amazing Grace", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$21.2M", "consensus": "Amazing Grace is your quintessential historical biopic: stately, noble, and with plenty of electrifying performances.", "critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 122, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1194912000000, "fresh": 85, "lastUpdated": 1440959053000, "production": "Samuel Goldwyn Films LLC", "rotten": 37, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 54076, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.amazinggracemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steven Knight"], "year": 2006}
