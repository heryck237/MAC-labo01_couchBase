A nurse gets into a dispute at work because she switches to speaking English when she gets nervous. A translator compromises her integrity when persuaded to translate a book she doesn't believe in. An elderly woman and her daughter are humiliated when offered a present of one million kroner from a relative. I Belong is a warm and nuanced film about people who all mean well, but end up hurting one another. About how people who act on integrity and feelings are seen as troublesome in a society where the ideal is to behave rationally. A playful tragedy-comedy about how what seems like something of little importance to one person, can seem like a grand disaster to another.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2377396, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 403}, "languages": ["Norwegian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 00:39:55.773000000", "plot": "What happens to us when people stop acting like they're supposed to?
