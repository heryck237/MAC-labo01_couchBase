Within this volatile climate, filmmakers Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny take us to the frontline in Syria and Libya, where shrapnel, bullet holes, and unmarked graves provide mounting evidence of coordinated attacks conducted by Bashar al-Assad and the now-deceased Muammar Gaddafi. The crimes are rampant, random, and often undocumented, making E-Team's effort to get information out of the country and into the hands of media outlets and criminal courts all the more necessary.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 3456090, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 338}, "languages": ["English", "German", "Arabic", "Russian", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:08:28.957000000", "metacritic": 66, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "When atrocities are committed in countries held hostage by ruthless dictators, Human Rights Watch sends in the E-Team (Emergencies Team), a collection of fiercely intelligent individuals ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NDExNDYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyOTczMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1413936000000, "runtime": 88, "title": "E-Team", "type": "movie", "year": 2014}
