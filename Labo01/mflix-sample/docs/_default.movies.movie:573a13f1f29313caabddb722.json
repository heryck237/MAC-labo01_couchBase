Her mother gets on her nerves, boys her age are stupid and everything anyone wants to do seems childish. One day Laura's energetic friend Merit invites her on a hike to a bog led by a middle-aged nature-lover called Joosep. The beginning of the trip is anything but promising: the relation- ship between the reserved girl and the outgoing Joosep, who tries to impress the hiking party with his hillbilly style and bizarre rituals, becomes tense. But much to her own surprise, Laura discovers that as the hike continues she is enchanted by the rugged charms of Joosep. The quest is coming to its irrefutable end and Laura has to decide whether a relationship with an older man is a mere step along the winding road towards becoming a woman or whether it is her very first love.", "genres": ["Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 3776402, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 208}, "languages": ["Estonian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:54:44.193000000", "plot": "Cherry Tobacco is about a small-town girl, Laura, who is constantly bored.
