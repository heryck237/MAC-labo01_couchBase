Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 181852, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 279627}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:08:28.273000000", "metacritic": 66, "plot": "A cybernetic warrior from a post-apocalyptic future travels back in time to protect a 19-year old drifter and his future wife from a most advanced robotic assassin and to ensure they both survive a nuclear attack.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NzM1ODgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5MjAzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1057104000000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$150.3M", "consensus": "Although T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.", "critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 201, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1068508800000, "fresh": 141, "lastUpdated": 1442080592000, "production": "Warner Bros.
