Like an abundance of Swedes her age, she has fled the mass unemployment of her home country in search of a more worthwhile existence in a nouveau-riche Oslo. But her new life is caught in deadlock - Dino finds herself stuck in a destructive loop of temporary jobs, financial trouble and hard partying. A broken arm incidentally leads to a position as a housekeeper in a Norwegian middle-class home. Dino is thrown into a reality very far from her own. During a few sultry summer weeks she ends up the centre of an odd love triangle, an unpredictable struggle for affection as well as dominance. \"Underdog\" is a tender and raw story of privilege and longing, yet at the same time a humorous and unmerciful observation of the shifted power balance between Sweden and Norway - an actuality where Swedes have become the Norwegians' servants.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 4026914, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 204}, "languages": ["Swedish", "Norwegian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:06:39.313000000", "plot": "23-year-old \"Dino\" (Bianca Kronl\u00e8f) dreams of a different life.
