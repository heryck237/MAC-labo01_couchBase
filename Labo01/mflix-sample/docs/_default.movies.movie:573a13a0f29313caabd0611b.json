The director talks about the novel upon which the film is based, we see the crew at work, the actors talk about what's going on. Y, a schoolgirl of 18, chooses her first lover (rather than wait to be raped, as were her two older sisters). After phone sex with J, a sculptor who's 38, they begin an affair that, by the second meeting, includes spankings as foreplay. J brings a suitcase full of rods, hoses, and wires; Y gathers sticks to bring. Y's brother discovers the affair. J's wife, studying in Paris, calls him to join her. Will the lovers part? Will the violence get out of hand? When do the lies begin?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 208995, "rating": 5.7, "votes": 1208}, "languages": ["Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 05:13:25.863000000", "metacritic": 47, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A conscious exploration of fantasy and flesh.
