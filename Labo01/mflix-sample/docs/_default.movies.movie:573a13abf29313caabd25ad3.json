People cannot travel unless they have \"papeles\" (papers in Spanish; words and sentences in many languages, especially Spanish, French and Chinese are mixed with English in this new world), a special travel permit issued by the totalitarian government, the \"Sphinx\". Outside these cities, the desert has taken over and shanty towns are jammed with non-citizens - people without IDs forced to live primitive lives. William is a family man who works as a government investigator. When he is sent to Shanghai to solve a case of fake IDs, he meets a woman named Maria. Although he realizes she is behind the forgeries, he cannot help but fall completely in love with her. He hides her crime and they have a wild, passionate affair that can only last as long as his visa: 24 hours. Back home, William is obsessed with the memory of Maria. When the original investigation is inevitably re-opened a week later and William is sent back to finish the work he started, he tracks her down, only to discover she has been accused of a Code 46 violation and any further relationship is impossible.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 345061, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 17454}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 01:06:51.357000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A futuristic 'Brief Encounter', a love story in which the romance is doomed by genetic incompatibility.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzU4OTk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg5MzI3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1095379200000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Code 46", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 51, "numReviews": 97, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1104192000000, "fresh": 49, "lastUpdated": 1439835798000, "production": "MGM", "rotten": 48, "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 8545, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.mgm.com/ua/code46/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Frank Cottrell Boyce"], "year": 2003}
