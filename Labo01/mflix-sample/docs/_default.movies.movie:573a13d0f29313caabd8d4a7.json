All Shirley wants is to gather her three adult children around her and share the news as a family. But Tammy, Kimberly and Byron are too distracted by their own problems: Tammy can't manage her unruly children or her broken marriage; Kimberly is gripped with anger and takes it out on her husband; and Byron, after spending two years in jail, is under pressure to deal drugs again. It's up to Madea, with the help of the equally rambunctious Aunt Bam, to gather the clan together and make things right the only way she knows how: with a lot of tough love, laughter ... and the revelation of a long-buried family secret.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1787759, "rating": 4.4, "votes": 5789}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:54:10.010000000", "metacritic": 45, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The crazy and comical Mabel Simmoms, otherwise known as Madea, tries to wrangle her fighting family together for a family dinner regarding the health of her niece Shirley.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NDQzNDAwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYxNzk0NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1303430400000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Madea's Big Happy Family", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$53.3M", "critic": {"meter": 38, "numReviews": 40, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 1314662400000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1441135825000, "production": "Lionsgate", "rotten": 25, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 30896, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.MadeasBigHappyFamilyMovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tyler Perry (screenplay)"], "year": 2011}
