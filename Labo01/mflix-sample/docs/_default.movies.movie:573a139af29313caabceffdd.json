On the chaotic set, she's aided by Zoe, the wardrobe mistress with a crush on her; she defends Vidal to a Parisian journalist who trashes all French film and praises John Woo and Schwarzenegger; she befriends Vidal when he goes over the edge; and, in costume, she breaks into a hotel suite to steal jewels as her victim talks on the phone. We also watch the making, the rushes, and the remains of Vidal's unfinished film.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 116650, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 3374}, "languages": ["French", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:32:36.773000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A Chinese movie actress, in France to star in a remake of \"Les Vampires\", finds petty intrigues and clashing egos on the set.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNzc4MjkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUyNDUwMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 862358400000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Irma Vep", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 35, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 891302400000, "fresh": 32, "lastUpdated": 1438281513000, "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 2890, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Olivier Assayas"], "year": 1996}
