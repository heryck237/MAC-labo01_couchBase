PRAG is the story of a distant, ever-absent father who, even after passing away, traumatizes all who have known him. And PRAG is the story of a marriage on the verge of collapse, in which Christoffer wants one thing and Maja another. A story of an old love, constantly transformed; at once, rooted, fragile, vulnerable, forgotten and rediscovered. A marriage where secrets, one after the other, come bursting out of the closet.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 855975, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2062}, "languages": ["Danish", "English", "Czech"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:22:25.423000000", "plot": "Christoffer and Maja's trip to Prague to bring back Chistoffer's deceased father evolves into the story of a break-up.
