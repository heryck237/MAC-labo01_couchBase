At 30, she lives in Camden: cheeky, playful, frank while funny, and talkative to strangers. She's a conscientious and exuberant primary-school teacher, flatmates with Zoe, her long-time friend; she's close to one sister, and not so close to another. In this slice of life story, we watch her take driving lessons from Scott, a dour and tightly-wound instructor, take classes in flamenco dance from a fiery Spaniard, encounter a tramp in the night, and sort out a student's aggressive behavior with a social worker's help. Along the way, we wonder if her open attitude puts her at risk of misunderstanding or worse. What is the root of happiness?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1045670, "rating": 7, "votes": 30701}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:29:31.460000000", "metacritic": 84, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A look at a few chapters in the life of Poppy, a cheery, colorful, North London schoolteacher whose optimism tends to exasperate those around her.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4ODY1MjIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExMTM5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1227225600000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Happy-Go-Lucky", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$3.5M", "consensus": "Mike Leigh's latest partially-improvised film is a light-hearted comedy with moments that bite, and features a brilliant star turn by Sally Hawkins.", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 153, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 1236643200000, "fresh": 142, "lastUpdated": 1440183238000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 34476, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.happygoluckythemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mike Leigh"], "year": 2008}
