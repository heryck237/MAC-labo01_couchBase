His roommate sums up his goals when he observes of David, \"He's not for the team, and he never will be\"; but precisely who the David is that David is so fiendishly striving for we're never to learn. He develops a short-lived relationship with Carole Stahl, a glamorous European woman even more capricious than himself. Chappellet's identity trouble are exacerbated by the fact that he is an \"Event\" as well as a personality; and more astute minds than his own have difficulty where the one leaves off and the other takes over.
