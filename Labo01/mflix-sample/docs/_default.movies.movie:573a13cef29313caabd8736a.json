He's a Gospel-singing tenor. In a series of interviews with townspeople, mixed with flashbacks, we follow Bernie: he arrives in Carthage, Texas (pop. 7,000), where old ladies adore him; he befriends a wealthy, mean-spirited widow named Marjorie Nugent; they become companions in both daily routines and expensive vacations. Among those interviewed, only her stockbroker and Danny Buck, the local district attorney, are unsympathetic toward the sunny, sometimes saccharine Bernie. Marjorie changes from sour and alone to happy with Bernie; then she gets possessive. What will sweet Bernie do?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1704573, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 41085}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:58:27.087000000", "metacritic": 75, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In small-town Texas, an affable mortician strikes up a friendship with a wealthy widow, though when she starts to become controlling, he goes to great lengths to separate himself from her grasp.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NDEwODU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwNzc0Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1340323200000, "runtime": 104, "title": "Bernie", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$5.9M", "consensus": "Richard Linklater's Bernie is a gently told and unexpectedly amusing true-crime comedy that benefits from an impressive performance by Jack Black.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 148, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 1345507200000, "fresh": 133, "lastUpdated": 1442254370000, "production": "Millenium Entertainment", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 40181, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://bernie-the-movie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Skip Hollandsworth (based on the article in Texas Monthly by)", "Richard Linklater (screenplay)", "Skip Hollandsworth (screenplay)"], "year": 2011}
