On the morning of her fourteenth birthday April has a devastating row with her foster mother, Marion and leaves the house determined to find out where she really comes from, who she really is and maybe, just maybe, find her real mother. Telling no-one what she's up to or where she's going, April skips school and begins the search she's dreamed about all her life. It's a blur of social workers, children's homes and special schools as April revisits and recalls the key scenes of her fragmented past. It's a painful journey, sometimes frightening but there's also friendship and love and laughter. And now she's started, there's no going back - April must find her mother.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1325734, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 425}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:02:43.647000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The film follows the story of young teen April whose troubled life began in a dustbin - a new born baby, abandoned and alone, not celebrated, not wanted but discarded and left like so much ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MzE0MzQwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg5MjA2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1229817600000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Dustbin Baby", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442167859000, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 220, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Helen Blakeman (screenplay)", "Jacqueline Wilson (novel)"], "year": 2008}
