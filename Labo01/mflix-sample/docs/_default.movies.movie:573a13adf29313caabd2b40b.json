Playing in a seedy Bowery bar to a small group of fellow struggling musicians, the band struck a chord of disharmony that rocked the foundation of the mid-'70s music scene. This quartet of unlikely rock stars traveled across the country and around the world connecting with the disenfranchised everywhere, while sparking a movement that would resonate with two generations of outcasts across the globe. Although the band never reached the top of the Billboard charts, it managed to endure by maintaining a rigorous touring schedule for 22 years.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 368711, "rating": 8, "votes": 2782}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-26 00:25:57.437000000", "metacritic": 74, "plot": "The story of the punk rock band The Ramones.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMzAwNTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxMjgyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1101513600000, "runtime": 110, "title": "End of the Century", "type": "movie", "year": 2003}
