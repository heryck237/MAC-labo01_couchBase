A psychedelic whirlwind of snapshots, Super-8 home movies, old answering machine messages, video diaries, early short films, snippets of '80s pop culture, and dramatic reenactments to create an epic portrait of an American family travesty. The story begins in 2003 when Jonathan learns that his schizophrenic mother, Renee, has overdosed on her lithium medication. He is catapulted back into his real and horrifying family legacy of rape, abandonment, promiscuity, drug addiction, child abuse, and psychosis. As he grows up on camera, he finds the escapist balm of musical theater and B horror flicks and reconnects to life through a queer chosen family. Then a look into the future shows Jonathan as he confronts the symbiotic and almost unbearable love he shares with his beautiful and tragically damaged mother.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 390538, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 5543}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:26:45.720000000", "metacritic": 87, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Filmmaker Jonathan Caouette's documentary on growing up with his schizophrenic mother -- a mixture of snapshots, Super-8, answering machine messages, video diaries, early short films, and more -- culled from 19 years of his life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NzczNDE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcxMzcyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1100044800000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Tarnation", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jonathan Caouette"], "year": 2003}
