In China, workers gather outside the factory, exhorted by their team leader to produce more and make fewer errors. A woman assembles a circuit breaker, and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai, the world's fastest growing city, where wealth and poverty, high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 832903, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2242}, "languages": ["English", "Cantonese", "Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:40:02.217000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Photographer Edward Burtynsky travels the world observing changes in landscapes due to industrial work and manufacturing.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUyMzUzNDQ2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3OTQ1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1181692800000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Manufactured Landscapes", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 60, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1195516800000, "fresh": 50, "lastUpdated": 1439924557000, "production": "Zeitgeist Films", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 6137, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.mongrelmedia.com/films/ManufacturedLandscapes.html"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2006}
