Set against the backdrop of a heated national debate, director Michael Webber chronicles the extraordinary story of two men at the heart of the issue - Tim Harrison, an Ohio police officer whose friend was killed by an exotic pet; and Terry Brumfield, a mentally unstable man who struggles to selfishly raise two African lions that he loves like his own family in a small cage in his backyard. He does not understand the controversy over \"owning\" wild animals; the reality is, he keeps them for himself, not because he thinks it puts the lions in a good situation. In the first of many unexpected twists, the lives of these two men collide when Terry's male lion escapes its pen and is found attacking cars on a nearby highway. Winner of 5 Best Documentary Awards, the film courageously exposes the shocking reality behind the multi-billion dollar exotic pet industry with stunning photography, inspiring storytelling and unprecedented access into a world rarely seen, right in our own backyard.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1111313, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 864}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:50:41.517000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The Elephant in the Living Room takes viewers on a journey deep inside the controversial American subculture of raising the most dangerous animals in the world, as common household pets. ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDg1MDc0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5NTI2NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "runtime": 96, "title": "The Elephant in the Living Room", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 22, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1328486400000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1439921723000, "production": "WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 641, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.theelephantinthelivingroom.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2010}
