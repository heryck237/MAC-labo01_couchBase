Director Thomas Balm\u00e8s's film Happiness begins at the end of this process as Laya, the last remaining village tucked away within the Himalayan kingdom, becomes enmeshed in roads, electricity, and cable television. Through the eyes of an eight-year-old monk impatient with prayer and eager to acquire a TV set, we witness the seeds of this seismic shift sprouting during a three-day journey from the outskirts of Laya to the thriving capital of Thimphu. It is here the young boy discovers cars, toilets, colorful club lights, and countless other elements of modern life for the first time.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 3458776, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 186}, "languages": ["Dzongkha"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 01:07:52.290000000", "plot": "In 1999, King Jigme Wangchuck approved the use of television and Internet throughout the largely undeveloped nation of Bhutan, assuring the masses that rapid development was synonymous with...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcwNjI2MjE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUxNjk0NTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1383264000000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Happiness", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thomas Balm\u00e8s"], "year": 2013}
