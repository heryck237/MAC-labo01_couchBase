Her fondest wish -- just once before she dies -- is to revisit Bountiful, the small Texas town of her youth which she still refers to as \"home.\" The trouble is her son, Ludie, is too concerned for her health to allow her to travel alone and her petty daughter-in-law, Jessie Mae, insists they don't have money to squander on bus tickets. This prompts \"escape\" attempts each month which coincide with the arrival of Mrs. Watts' Social Security check. Then, Mrs. Watts makes a successful escape and last trip home.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 90203, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 2833}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:17:14.443000000", "plot": "In 1940s Texas, an elderly woman is determined to visit her childhood home for one last time.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJmNmE0ZGYtOTg2Ny00MmJjLWE1ZDItNGVlYzgxMjlhMmZhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 506908800000, "runtime": 108, "title": "The Trip to Bountiful", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Horton Foote (screenplay)", "Horton Foote (play)"], "year": 1985}
