Ern soon left for Bangkok, however, and it is six years later in their final school year when she is re-introduced to Ped and his brash best friend Koong (Pachara Chirathivat). Koong convinces Ped, along with schoolmate Ex (Thawat Pornrattanaprasert), to form a band, partly to be cool and attract girls, partly as an attempt by Koong to try and one-up his popular twin brother Kay.
