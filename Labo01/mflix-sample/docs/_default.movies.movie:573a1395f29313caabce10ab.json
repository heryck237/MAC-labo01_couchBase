His sister Lelia, who looks less African-American than White, is vulnerable and about to fall in love. Hugh, their older brother, is a struggling singer whose agent, Rupert, may be the only person with faith in his talent. The story moves back and forth, like jazz, among the three of them and what seems at first to be separate lives. Lelia meets Tony, and lets herself hope this is true love. Then he meets Hugh and prejudice gives Tony an excuse to cut and run. Can family and friendship bring solace for her hurt, purpose for Benny, and belief in Hugh? Is life more than shadows?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 53270, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 6448}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-13 00:49:41.037000000", "plot": "Cassavetes' jazz-scored improvisational film explores interracial friendships and relationships in Beat-Era (1950s) New York City.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYzMzBmYTQtYmRkZC00MjdjLTg5MzctYjU1OWRjYjdlYmU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": -277430400000, "runtime": 87, "title": "Shadows", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 17, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 891907200000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1441994464000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 4422, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Cassavetes"], "year": 1959}
