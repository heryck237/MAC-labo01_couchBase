Many suburbs away, an elderly widow loses her license to drive and turns to her wry younger neighbor for nostalgic cuddles and comfort. Meanwhile, a young urban sports fanatic meets a girl online and unexpectedly falls in love, though the trials the couple endure prove even more unexpected. Adam Reid's enchanting, compassionate debut weaves together the worlds of six lonely individuals as they negotiate the age-old process of giving and receiving love. It isn't easy, and it never happens the way they expect it, but for these isolated souls, there's an oddball magic in the way they make connections they never imagined.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1258201, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 249}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-14 00:01:10.993000000", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Lonely since his wife left him and alienated from his daughter, a cantankerous voice-over artist strikes up an unlikely friendship with his regular deliveryman.
