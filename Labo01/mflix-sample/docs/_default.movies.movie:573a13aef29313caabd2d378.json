One is Izo (Kazuya Nakayama), an assassin in the service of Hanpeida (Ryosuke Miki), a Tosa lord and Imperial supporter. After killing dozens of the Shogun's men, Izo is captured and crucified. Instead of being extinguished, his rage propels him through the space-time continuum to present-day Tokyo, where he finds himself one with the city's homeless. Here Izo transforms himself into a new, improved killing machine, his entire soul still enraged by his treatment in his past life. His response to the powers-that-be, whose predecessors put him to death, is the sword.", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 377079, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3810}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-11 00:08:50.953000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "An executed samurai takes an existential journey throughout time, space and eternity in search of bloody vengeance.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDY1MzM1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI3MzEzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1093046400000, "runtime": 128, "title": "Izo", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Shigenori Takechi (screenplay)"], "year": 2004}
