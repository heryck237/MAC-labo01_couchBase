While his class-mates bring their very own Tiffin-boxes, Stanley does not do so on the pretext that his mother is away, and shares food with Aman Mehra and others much to the chagrin of the Hindi Teacher, Babubhai Verma, who not only cajoles fellow-teachers, but virtually forces children, to share their food with him. With extra classes being imposed on both students and teachers, and the recess-breaks being doubled, parents are also forced to pack more food in lunch-boxes. When students evade Babubhai and continue sharing food with Stanley, he calls the latter aside and warns him that he cannot attend school until and unless he brings his own food. Watch what impact this has on Stanley, teachers, and his class-mates.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1907761, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 3161}, "languages": ["Hindi", "English", "Gujarati"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:45:16.360000000", "plot": "A school-teacher, who forces children to share their food with him, forbids one from entering the school until he brings his own Tiffin/Lunch-box.", "released": 1305244800000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Stanley's Tiffin Box", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1436382841000, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 200, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Amole Gupte"], "year": 2011}
