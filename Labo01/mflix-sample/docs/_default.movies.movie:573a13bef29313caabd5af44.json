Joe, General Abernathy (or Hawk) is on the trail of the thieves: an evil organization called \"Cobra\". While Duke and Ripcord train to join the Joes, McCullen (\"Destro\") is secretly working for Cobra and plotting to recapture his metal-eating \"Nanomite\" warheads. Duke and Ripcord (with help from Heavy Duty, Snake Eyes, and the rest of the Joes) must prove that they are Real American Heroes -- by stopping the launch of these warheads before Cobra uses them to take over the world.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 1046173, "rating": 5.8, "votes": 164423}, "languages": ["English", "French", "Scottish Gaelic"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:33:19.343000000", "metacritic": 32, "num_mflix_comments": 388, "plot": "An elite military unit comprised of special operatives known as G.I.
