However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1272878, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 142830}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 04:50:15.273000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "Two hardened criminals get into trouble with the US border patrol after meeting with a Mexican drug lord, and then revelations start to unfold.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ5MTgzNDg4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAyODEzOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1375401600000, "runtime": 109, "title": "2 Guns", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$75.6M", "consensus": "Formulaic and often jarringly violent, 2 Guns rests its old-school appeal on the interplay between its charismatic, well-matched stars.", "critic": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 171, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1384819200000, "fresh": 109, "lastUpdated": 1442340316000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 62, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 108747, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.2guns.net/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Blake Masters (screenplay)", "Steven Grant (based on the Boom!
