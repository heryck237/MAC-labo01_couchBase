He has spent most of his life in similar clinics, always released only to return again. Frightened and unsure of his identity, he prepares to go back into the real world. Outside of the clinic, he observes three different people at a bus stop and begins to perceive himself living their lives for a single day. One of the three people is also a heroin addict, a wretched figure who steals to get his next fix.
