Omar, an Israeli Arab, struggles to save his family from elimination by a gang of extortionists. He also courts a beautiful Christian girl, Hadir, but marrying her is far from obvious. Malek, an illegal Palestinian worker, tries to collect enough money to pay for his mother's operation. Dando, an Israeli cop, does his utmost to trace his missing brother who may have been killed by Palestinians. Binj, Malek and Omar's Arab friend, suffers from being rejected by other members of his community for mixing with an Israeli girl. All of them will meet violence, most of the time ... with violence.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1077262, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 4700}, "languages": ["Arabic", "Hebrew"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:05:11.423000000", "metacritic": 82, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Ajami is the religiously mixed community of Muslims and Christians in Tel Aviv.
