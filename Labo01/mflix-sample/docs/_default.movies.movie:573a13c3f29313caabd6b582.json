His most perfidious film was the treacherous anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S&uuml;&szlig; (1940) - required viewing for all SS members. An unrepentant and blindly obsessive craftsman, no figure - save for Leni Riefenstahl - is as closely associated with the cinema of the Holocaust years. (Harlan's epic Kolberg (1945) was the basis for Inglourious Basterds (2009)'s pivotal film-within-a-film Stolz Der Nation.) This documentary is an eye-opening examination of World War II film history as well as the story of a German family from the Third Reich to the present; one that is marked by reckoning, denial and liberation.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1327726, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 205}, "languages": ["German", "French", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:37:29.243000000", "metacritic": 73, "plot": "Though almost forgotten today, Veit Harlan was one of Nazi Germany's most notorious filmmakers.
