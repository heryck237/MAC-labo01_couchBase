Almost everywhere she is met with hostility or indifference. The only young boy who takes her to his school is thrown out by the teacher, because helping her prevented him from coming in time. - It must not go unnoticed that the schoolgirls and the female teacher are likewise hostile toward this girl. None of them want her in the classroom. On her way home she and other girls are taken as prisoners by boys playing talibans. They tear her school book to pieces (or rather what was left of it after the schoolgirls had done the same thing.) The \"taliban boys\" threaten to stone their girl prisoners (although in this movie there is little real physical violence against girls). The girl's attempts end in complete failure. (Whatever moods of the scenes throughout the entire movie, the acting by the central girl is really impressive.)", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 1094627, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1543}, "languages": ["Persian"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-10 00:16:24.730000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A young girl zealously wants to go to school and learn to read and write.
