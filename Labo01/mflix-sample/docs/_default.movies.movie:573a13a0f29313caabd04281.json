The first problem is Estelle's lack of confidence in Buddy. Then, Irish tenants upstairs refuse to move and won't pay rent; plus, the woman upstairs is about to have a baby. The next problem is the baby: once he's born, it's clear his father was Black. The Irish guy splits; Buddy evicts mother and child, then feels guilt and sets her up in a flat while she sorts out an adoption. Estelle's lack of faith, the Irish lass's spirit, Buddy's dream, racial prejudice, and the baby's fate play out.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 202641, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1381}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:24:18.990000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A dreamer finds that his wife and friends are binding him to his mediocre existence.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MTUzODAxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYyNjEyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 972604800000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Two Family House", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 34, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 991094400000, "fresh": 30, "lastUpdated": 1442253356000, "production": "Lions Gate Releasing", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 1016, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Raymond De Felitta"], "year": 2000}
