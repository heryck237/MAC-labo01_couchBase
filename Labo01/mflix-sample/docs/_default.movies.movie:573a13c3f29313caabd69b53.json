Oliver dies from a leg wound he refuses to have medically treated, so Moon is told to move away, alone, and start a new home in the Alaskan wild-lands. Constable Sanders, however - the mean local cop - finds the boy with his father's guns, abuses him and has him locked away till majority age for 'assault' within Mr. Gene's grim Pinson home for boys. Moon soon makes friends with shy, sickly Kit and apparent bully Hal, then sets up a mass escape, on which only the trio actually follows through. Sanders fails to catch them, but the unforgiving elements reshuffle the cards dramatically. An uncle is meanwhile found.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1300155, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 958}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:41:43.690000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "After the unexpected death of his survivalist father, an eleven-year-old boy raised in the Alabama wilderness must learn how to make a home in the modern world.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzYxNzMzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NTQ2NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1300406400000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Alabama Moon", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1305590400000, "lastUpdated": 1441135692000, "production": "Screen Media Ventures", "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 893, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.alabamamoonthemovie.net/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Watt Key (based upon the novel by)", "James Whittaker (screenplay)", "Watt Key (screenplay)"], "year": 2009}
