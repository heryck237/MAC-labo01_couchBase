Despite each having successful professional lives - Alexander being a cosmetic surgeon, Liz a magazine columnist, Victoria a real estate agent, and Meimei an actress in Chinese ninja movies - each sibling carries personal baggage, much associated with their mother's ways. Married Alexander, much like his now deceased father before him, has a mistress on the side, about which his ex-beauty pageant queen wife Cindy knows. Liz's son Sam passed away, the stress and grief from which led to her breaking-up with her Caucasian husband Michael. Victoria was forced to break-up with the only man she ever loved because he was black, that relationship which produced a son, Jason. And lesbian Meimei and her partner Dede want to have a baby, and are looking for a sperm donor. Mrs. Xiao's last wish was for her family to come together to hold a traditional week long Chinese funeral for her. Being brought up \"western\" (with a couple of them not even knowing their native tongue), the siblings must rely on the Xiao's longtime housekeeper and caregiver, a Jewish woman named Viola, to tell them how to proceed with the funeral. As the week progresses, the siblings learn of many things not previously known about their mother and their family in general, some of it having to do with another funeral attendee from Beijing, a man named Chow Lin. But the biggest secret of the the family is kept by Viola, who reveals all, with some help by the spirit of Mrs. Xiao, by week's end.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1216477, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 424}, "languages": ["English", "Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:30:36.570000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A story about a group of estranged Chinese-American siblings who reunite after the death of their mother.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlhZTNlMmItOTg5NS00ODliLTkyMTAtYjc4ZThkYjg0NDIwL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "runtime": 95, "title": "Dim Sum Funeral", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 0, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 3.3}, "dvd": 1248134400000, "fresh": 0, "lastUpdated": 1441992141000, "production": "HBO Films", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 36, "numReviews": 309, "rating": 2.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Donald Martin"], "year": 2008}
