While Eastman and patrician schoolteacher Elaine Goodale work to improve life for the Indians on the reservation, Senator Dawes lobbies President Grant for more humane treatment, opposing the bellicose stance of General William Tecumseh Sherman. Hope rises for the Indians in the form of the prophet Wovoka and the Ghost Dance - a messianic movement that promises an end of their suffering under the white man. This hope is obliterated after the assassination of Sitting Bull and the massacre of hundreds of Indian men, women and children by the 7th Cavalry at Wounded Knee Creek on Dec. 29, 1890.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Western"], "imdb": {"id": 821638, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 4227}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-04 00:20:45.977000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A chronicle of how American Indians were displaced as the U.S. expanded west.
