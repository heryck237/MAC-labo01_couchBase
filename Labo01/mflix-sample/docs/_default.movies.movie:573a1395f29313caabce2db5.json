The ridiculous passes for sublime. Polly becomes the subject of an episode of a vapid TV news documentary series called \"Qui \u00e8tes-vous?\" and is pursued by the filmmaker and by the prince of Borodine, a small country in the Soviet bloc. We watch as the documentary is shot, we await Polly's arrival in the principality, we observe a lunch in the suburbs, and we learn of her childhood. Is there more to Polly than her pretty face? Is anything below the surface?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 60879, "rating": 7, "votes": 638}, "languages": ["French", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-04-22 00:10:51.613000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In this excoriating satire of the fashion industry, Polly Maggoo is a 20-year-old Brooklyn-born fashion model in Paris, on the runway at the big shows where magazine editor Ms. Maxwell is ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFjMjczMGYtMzNmYi00ZjM0LWIyZDYtY2U4NmYxMjcwOGM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -100915200000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Who Are You, Polly Magoo?", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1211241600000, "lastUpdated": 1439320157000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 589, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Klein (screenplay)"], "year": 1966}
