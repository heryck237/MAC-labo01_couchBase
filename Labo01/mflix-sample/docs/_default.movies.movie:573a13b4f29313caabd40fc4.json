The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.", "genres": ["Action", "Horror", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 462322, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 146526}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:12:28.883000000", "metacritic": 77, "plot": "Quentin Tarantino and Rober Rodriguez's homage to drive-in double features in the 60s and 70s with two back-to-back cult films that include previews of coming attractions between them.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzExNzc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAxMzM0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1175817600000, "runtime": 191, "title": "Grindhouse", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$24.9M", "consensus": "Grindhouse delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence.", "critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 191, "rating": 7.4}, "fresh": 159, "lastUpdated": 1442428181000, "production": "The Weinstein Co./Dimension", "rotten": 32, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 329366, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://grindhousemovie.net/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert Rodriguez", "Rob Zombie", "Edgar Wright", "Jeff Rendell", "Eli Roth", "Quentin Tarantino", "Rob Cotterill (story)", "Jason Eisener (story)", "John Davies (fake trailer segment \"Hobo with a Shotgun\")"], "year": 2007}
