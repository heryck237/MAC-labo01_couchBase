It is not a comedy though the characters often say funny things. It is not a detective story even though the hero is trying to solve a murder. It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour. A few draughts of Strawberry Wine are enough to take us into a magical world in the true centre of Europe, where love, crime and penitence are just as much a part of life as the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds or the flowing of a mountain stream.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1260596, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 301}, "languages": ["Polish"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-31 01:23:38.237000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "This is not a love story though it is full of love.
