The film examines the powerful forces trying to maintain the status quo in a medical industry designed for quick fixes rather than prevention, for profit-driven care rather than patient-driven care. After decades of resistance, a movement to bring innovative high-touch, low-cost methods of prevention and healing into our high-tech, costly system is finally gaining ground. ESCAPE FIRE follows dramatic human stories as well as leaders fighting to transform healthcare at the highest levels of medicine, industry, government, and even the US military. The film is about a way out, about saving the health of a nation.", "genres": ["Documentary", "News"], "imdb": {"id": 2093109, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 401}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:50:38.170000000", "metacritic": 67, "plot": "An investigative documentary that uncovers the U.S. healthcare system's true design.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MDA1NDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYzNTYxOA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1349395200000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$97.3k", "critic": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 21, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1361750400000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1442264462000, "production": "Roadside Attractions", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 570, "rating": 4.3}, "website": "http://www.escapefiremovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2012}
