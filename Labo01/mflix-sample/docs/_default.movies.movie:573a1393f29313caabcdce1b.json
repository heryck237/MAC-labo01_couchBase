She naps and, perhaps, dreams. She sees a hooded figure going down the driveway. The knife is on the stair, then in her bed. The hooded figure puts the flower on her bed then disappears. The woman sees it all happen again. Downstairs, she naps, this time in a chair. She awakes to see a man going upstairs with the flower. He puts it on the bed. The knife is handy. Can these dream-like sequences end happily? A mirror breaks, the man enters the house again. Will he find her?", "genres": ["Short"], "imdb": {"id": 36154, "rating": 8, "votes": 5958}, "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:05:40.157000000", "plot": "A woman returning home falls asleep and has vivid dreams that may or may not be happening in reality.
