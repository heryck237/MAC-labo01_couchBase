Financially strapped and untrained in anything but basketball, Jamal comes up with a plan so outrageous it just might work: dress up like a woman and try out for the woman's basketball league. To his surprise, he makes it, but now the real challenge begins - to cease being Jamal and start new life as Juwanna. Matters become even more complicated when Juwanna realizes that he is falling for his teammate Michelle, who shows him that there is more to women than meets the eye.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 247444, "rating": 4.5, "votes": 5148}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:18:00.960000000", "metacritic": 24, "plot": "A basketball star is booted out of the NBA when his on-court antics go too far, so he poses as a woman and joins the WUBA.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNjE0NDQ0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU1MDY3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1024617600000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Juwanna Mann", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$13.4M", "consensus": "With its tired premise, Juwanna Mann's jokes fall flat.", "critic": {"meter": 10, "numReviews": 83, "rating": 3.2}, "dvd": 1037664000000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1441134576000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 75, "viewer": {"meter": 39, "numReviews": 8323, "rating": 2.6}, "website": "http://www.juwannamann.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bradley Allenstein"], "year": 2002}
