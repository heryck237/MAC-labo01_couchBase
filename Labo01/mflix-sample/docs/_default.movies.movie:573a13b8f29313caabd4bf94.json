He's making a film about women's pleasure as they transgress taboos. He doesn't know that two fallen angels who've been sent to upend him are manipulating his interest. He interviews young women, video tapes screen tests, and selects several for the film. The erotic scenes with them generate off-screen dynamics that may overwhelm the project. His wife is at first ignorant of his venture, then she's put off, and then becomes his assistant. The fallen angels are always close at hand: is Fran\u00e8ois's ruin inevitable?", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 792948, "rating": 5.4, "votes": 2258}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:08:49.843000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A filmmaker (van den Driessche) holds a series of boundary-pushing auditions for his project about female pleasure.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MDg1NzkwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE0NTM0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1158105600000, "runtime": 100, "title": "The Exterminating Angels", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Explicit and shocking, but there is no substance or statement on human behavior underneath the taboo-breaking.", "critic": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 44, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 1185235200000, "fresh": 21, "lastUpdated": 1441050705000, "production": "IFC First Take", "rotten": 23, "viewer": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 2536, "rating": 2.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jean-Claude Brisseau"], "year": 2006}
