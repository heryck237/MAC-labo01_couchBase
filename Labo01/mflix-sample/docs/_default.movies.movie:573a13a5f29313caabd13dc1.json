Shant\u00e8 is so adept at navigating the waters of romance that her best girlfriends Diedre, Karen and Tracye depend on her for advice whenever \"man trouble\" clouds the horizon. But when Shant\u00e8's boyfriend Keith is caught red-handed stepping out with a co-worker, Shant\u00e8 institutes her \"Ten Day Plan\" to get her man in line. Whether its sexy lingerie or good home cooking, Shant\u00e8 has an arsenal of weapons designed to bring a man to his knees...and back to her. She's not above playing the damsel in distress or using the ever-reliable local grapevine to get Keith's attention. It's all good, because getting her man back - by any means necessary - is all that matters. Unfortunately the happy ending that Shant\u00e8 expects goes sideways when Keith begins following the advice of his buddy Tony, who brings a player's perspective to the games girls play. In this comedic battle of the sexes, Shante's about to discover that not only are there no rules - she's not the only one playing. With her relationship at stake and her friends checking her every move, Shant\u00e8 has to think fast and stay a step ahead of Keith if she has any hope of bringing her man back...with her pride intact.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 269341, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 4052}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 01:06:39.760000000", "metacritic": 35, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An arrogant career woman plays a series of heartless mind-games with her boyfriend to \"put him in line,\" only to discover that he has a few tricks up his own sleeve.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTU5MTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY5NDIyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 999820800000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Two Can Play That Game", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$22.0M", "consensus": "As a romantic comedy, Two Can Play That Game is more mean-spirited than romantic.
