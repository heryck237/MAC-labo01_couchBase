His name is Robin Williams and he's an up and coming comic on the Los Angeles comedy circuit. While on the other end of town, producer Garry Marshall and partner Harvey Severson have developed a new show called Mork & Mindy, that's a spinoff to their previous hit show \"Happy Days\". It's in their meeting with Williams that they have found the ideal actor to play Mork. But as the show slowly turns into a hit, the story of what happened behind the camera unfolds as a young comic is suddenly handed everything he ever wanted very quickly, which affected his personal life as well as those in it. Set against the backdrop of Mork & Mindy, this is a story about a show's rise to number one, it's struggles on the production, and the rising star of Robin Williams.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 437856, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 340}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-08 00:12:30.853000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An inside look at the ABC sitcom which turned Robin Williams into a star in 1978.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDQxODQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE2NzgyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1112572800000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of 'Mork & Mindy'", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A smart mockumentary that presents a gory, funny, and obviously affectionate skewering of the slasher genre.", "critic": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 38, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1089072000000, "fresh": 28, "lastUpdated": 1440965751000, "production": "Anchor Bay", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 14907, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.behindthemaskthemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Andy Dougan (book)", "David Misch"], "year": 2005}
