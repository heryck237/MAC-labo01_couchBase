But when they meet again in present-day London things are definitely not the same. Karl is now Kim, a transsexual, and she has no desire to stir up the past while she's busy forging a neat and orderly new life. Prentice, on the other hand, has charm but is a social disaster stuck in a dead-end job. His main talent is for getting them both into trouble. Amid the squabbles, they start to fall in love. One night, Kim invites Prentice to a romantic dinner at her flat. Prentice, finding the seduction unexpectedly effective, freaks out. He proceeds to make a public display of both of them and winds up in court. Humiliated and angry, Kim runs away. Only she can save Prentice now, but will true love triumph for a new made woman and an aging punk?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 116102, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1472}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:59:10.843000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Karl Foyle and Paul Prentice were best mates at school in the Seventies.
