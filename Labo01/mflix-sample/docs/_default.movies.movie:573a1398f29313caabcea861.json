Coal miners, struggling to form a union, are up against company operators and the gun thugs of the notorious Baldwin-Felts detective agency.

UMWA organizer and dual-card Wobbly Joe Kenehan determines to bring the local, Black, and Italian groups together. While Kenehan and his story are fictional, the setting and the dramatic climax are historical; Sid Hatfield, Cabell C. Testerman, C. E. Lively and the Felts brothers were real-life participants, and 'Few Clothes' is based on a character active several years previously.", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 93509, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 5769}, "languages": ["English", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 03:34:15.317000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A labor union organizer comes to an embattled mining community brutally and violently dominated and harassed by the mining company.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMzcwODYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk5MzYyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 583632000000, "runtime": 135, "title": "Matewan", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 29, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 943315200000, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1438198508000, "production": "Cinecom Pictures", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 3983, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Sayles"], "year": 1987}
