One of the surprises was an all-woman cast, novel in the 1930's. And although there were no men in the cast, most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce, in the 1930's, was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks, and reluctantly divorces him, abetted by her friends, all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada, where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy. The 1939 film, starring Norma Shearer, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell, and Joan Crawford, was a hit. This one, with an even better looking cast, is definitely not, largely because someone tried to move a 1930's situation comedy into the present.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 430770, "rating": 4.9, "votes": 15771}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:40:34.777000000", "metacritic": 27, "num_mflix_comments": 5, "plot": "A wealthy New Yorker wrestles with the decision to leave her cheating husband, as she and her friends discover that women really can have it all.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjg2MTk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQxMzk3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1221177600000, "runtime": 114, "title": "The Women", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$26.8M", "consensus": "The Women is a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original.", "critic": {"meter": 13, "numReviews": 143, "rating": 3.9}, "dvd": 1229644800000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1440442862000, "production": "Picturehouse Entertainment", "rotten": 125, "viewer": {"meter": 37, "numReviews": 61952, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://www.TheWomenTheMovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Diane English (screenplay)", "Clare Boothe Luce (play)", "Anita Loos", "Jane Murfin"], "year": 2008}
