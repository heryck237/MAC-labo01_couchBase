The Pruitt-Igoe Myth explores the social, economic and legislative issues that led to the decline of conventional public housing in America, and the city centers in which they resided, while tracing the personal and poignant narratives of several of the project's residents. In the post-War years, the American city changed in ways that made it unrecognizable from a generation earlier, privileging some and leaving others in its wake. The next time the city changes, remember Pruitt-Igoe.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1788461, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 553}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:52:41.897000000", "metacritic": 70, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Destroyed in a dramatic and highly-publicized implosion, the Pruitt-Igoe public housing complex has become a widespread symbol of failure amongst architects, politicians and policy makers. ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNDM3MzU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE0NDA2NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1347926400000, "runtime": 79, "title": "The Pruitt-Igoe Myth", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$44.7k", "critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 19, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 1337731200000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1439752586000, "production": "First Run Features", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 308, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.pruitt-igoe.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Chad Freidrichs (script)", "Jaime Freidrichs (script)"], "year": 2011}
