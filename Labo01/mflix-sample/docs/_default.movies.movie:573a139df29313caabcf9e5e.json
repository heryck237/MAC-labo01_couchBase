Maureen Sullivan and two of her clients agreed to have the entire progression of their therapy taped, and what emerges is a disarming and compassionate look at the struggles people face in connecting with one another. Twenty-five-year-old Kipper is a virginal grad student who gets nervous just talking to a girl, let alone touching her, and John, at 45, is newly divorced and suffering from fears of sexual inadequacy. As Maureen attempts to build up their confidence, she also exposes her own doubts in this touching film that dismisses a clinical approach to sex.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 158863, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 128}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-04-25 00:50:05.027000000", "plot": "In this cult doc from 1985, director Kirby Dick (This Film Is Not Yet Rated) weaves a fascinating study of the curious role of a sex surrogate in the then-new discipline of sexual therapy. ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2ODkxNzkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg3OTQyMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 528076800000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1232928000000, "lastUpdated": 1441135950000, "production": "Lightning Video", "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 90, "rating": 3}}, "type": "movie", "year": 1986}
