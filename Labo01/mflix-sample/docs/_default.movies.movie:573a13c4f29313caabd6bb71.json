The film's thesis is that post-9/11 the government has seized unprecedented license to surveil, intimidate, arrest, and detain citizens and foreigners alike. The film also looks back to the Pentagon Papers' case and compares it to cases since 9/11 dealing with high school students' speech and protesters marching in New York City during the 2004 Republican convention. Comment comes from a range of scholars, pundits, and advocates.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1333657, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 179}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:45:52.117000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "First Amendment attorney Martin Garbus talks about the history and current state of free speech in America", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg3ODI3MDY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI2MDA5NTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1230768000000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Shouting Fire: Stories from the Edge of Free Speech", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1435085396000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 149, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2009}
