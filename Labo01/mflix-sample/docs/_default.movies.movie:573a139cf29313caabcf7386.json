The film then moves on to her sisters. One is a happily married woman with a psychiatrist husband and three kids. Unfortunately the husband develops an unnatural fascination for his 11 year old son's male classmates, fantasizes about mass killing in a park, and masturbates to teen magazines. One of his patients has an unrequited fascination for the third sister. Meanwhile the apparently stable 40 year marriage of the sister's parents suddenly unravels when he decides he has had enough and wants to live a hermit's life in Florida. Obviously, the whole movie is slightly warped in its viewpoint and certainly presents abnormal relationships among all of its parties.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 147612, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 52434}, "languages": ["English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:49.283000000", "metacritic": 81, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The lives of many individuals connected by the desire for happiness, often from sources usually considered dark or evil.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FlNzE0ZmUtMmVkZS00MWQ3LWE4OWQtYjQwZjdhNzRmNWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 908496000000, "runtime": 134, "title": "Happiness", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 46, "rating": 7.9}, "dvd": 925171200000, "fresh": 39, "lastUpdated": 1440698545000, "production": "Trimark Pictures", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 41112, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Todd Solondz"], "year": 1998}
