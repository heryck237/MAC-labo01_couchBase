But their trip takes a detour into an area closed off from the public, but more importantly from society. An area originally used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing that was intended to be empty...or so they thought? When the Carter's car breaks down at the old site, they're stranded...or are they? As the Carters may soon realize that what seemed like a car casually breaking down, might actually be a trap. This trap might be perpetrated by the inhabitants of the site who aren't pulling a prank, but are out to set up a gruesome massacre.", "genres": ["Horror", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 454841, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 119518}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:07:55.283000000", "metacritic": 52, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A suburban American family is being stalked by a group of psychotic people who live in the desert, far away from civilization.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0MTg5MzEyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUyMzIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1141948800000, "runtime": 107, "title": "The Hills Have Eyes", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$41.7M", "consensus": "Faster paced for today's audiences, this Hills remake ratchets up the gore for the hardcore horror fans, but will turn away casual audiences.", "critic": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 136, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 1204588800000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1442083499000, "production": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "rotten": 69, "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 391982, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thehillshaveeyes/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Alexandre Aja (screenplay)", "Gr\u00e8gory Levasseur (screenplay)", "Wes Craven"], "year": 2006}
