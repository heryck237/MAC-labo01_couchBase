Francis Phelan and Helen Archer are bums, back in their birth city. She was a singer on the radio, he a major league pitcher. Death surrounds them: she's sick, a pal has cancer, he digs graves at the cemetery and visits the grave of his infant son whom he dropped; visions of his past haunt him, including ghosts of two men he killed. That night, out drinking, Helen tries to sing at a bar. Next day, Fran visits his wife and children and meets a grandson. He could stay, but decides it's not for him. Helen gets their things out of storage and finds a hotel. Amidst their mistakes and dereliction, the film explores their code of fairness and loyalty.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 93277, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 5806}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:40:26.963000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A schizophrenic drifter spends Halloween in his home town after returning there for the first time in decades.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgyMmExYmEtOGM0NC00MjU3LTg4M2QtODRmNWM2NDgzMGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 570672000000, "runtime": 143, "title": "Ironweed", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1235433600000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1442083646000, "production": "Vestron Video", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 2748, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Kennedy (novel)", "William Kennedy (screenplay)"], "year": 1987}
