With a wooden leg and his wife Ethel's (June Allyson) help, Stratton made a successful minor league comeback in 1946, continuing to pitch in minor leagues throughout the rest of the 1940s and into the 1950s.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 41928, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1805}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:59:11.600000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Star major league pitcher Monty Stratton loses a leg in a hunting accident, but becomes determined to leave the game on his own terms.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQwOTc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg1NDgyMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -649641600000, "runtime": 106, "title": "The Stratton Story", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 6, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1155600000000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1441912494000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 1231, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Douglas Morrow (screenplay)", "Guy Trosper (screenplay)", "Douglas Morrow (story)"], "year": 1949}
