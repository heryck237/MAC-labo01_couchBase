After a frustrating night in the local club, the two boys decide to hang out on the beach at sunrise. What starts as an innocent game soon develops into an ambiguous confrontation, when Matthieu takes his friend along into the abandoned building, and provokes him by making fun of Germany's past. After a chase through Prora's endless hallways, Jan provokes Matthieu in return by suddenly kissing him on the lips.
