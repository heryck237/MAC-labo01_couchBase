Dr. Jamie Dodd is elated : he has finally succeeded in capturing not one, but two pygmies. He brings them to Scotland with the help of Elena Van den Ende, an adventurous woman who sells wild animals to the zoos of Europe. His two anthropologist friends, Alexander and Fraser, and himself are certain they have discovered the missing link, which will make them famous. They start examining the pygmy couple from every angle and Jamie gradually discovers that Toko and Likola are just as sensitive and intelligent as any other homo sapiens. His two colleagues strongly reject this idea as it is glory they are after not the truth. Will Jamie be able to prove the two short people are genuine human beings and not freaks to be shown in a zoo?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 397530, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 1721}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:39:20.723000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An epic about anthropologists who hunt and capture pygmies for study back in Europe, in an attempt to illustrate the link between man and ape.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIxMmVmYmEtMTc3ZC00NWMyLWIyZjQtN2I4OTFlYzE2MWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE4NzY3Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1113350400000, "runtime": 122, "title": "Man to Man", "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Boyd", "Michel Fessler (screenplay)", "Fred Fougea (screenplay)", "R\u00e8gis Wargnier"], "year": 2005}
