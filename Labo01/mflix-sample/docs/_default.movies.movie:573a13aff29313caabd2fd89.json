In flashbacks told around a pretend car trip they take - so he can practice driving - we see Paul's infancy, their fun together (sometimes with a manic edge), and his growing desire to go to school and be with other kids. We also flash back to Emily's childhood, with parents so bound up with each other that she's virtually ignored. Is Emily going to be able to let Paul be with others? Or, can she, as in the David Bowie song she sings at a school talent show, construct a life on Mars?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 388213, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 2626}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 01:28:24.490000000", "metacritic": 45, "plot": "A neglected daughter becomes a possessive mother in an emotional journey into the heart and mind of a woman who loved too much.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTgzOTI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg3OTIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1114646400000, "runtime": 84, "title": "Loverboy", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hannah Shakespeare (screenplay)", "Victoria Redel (novel)"], "year": 2005}
