He doesn't remember why he is there and where he came from. He has a terrible stomach injury and is slowly bleeding to death. He begins to explore the narrow confines of his prison and crawls around the maze-like room, only to see a horrible vision of hell waiting for him at each end of the room. Finally he gives up on the struggle and collapses in exhaustion. Then he begins to remember images from his past. Clinging to these images he creeps forward with the last ounces of his strength and meets a woman in a place that stinks of rotting corpses. The man and the woman both try to recall where they came from, but their memories are so uncertain that they are not even sure they want to return. The man is ready to give up but the woman insists on going forward. Neither of them can imagine the incredible end to the journey.", "genres": ["Horror", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 491399, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 1753}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:17:23.610000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A man wakes up to find himself locked in a tiny, cramped concrete room, in which he can barely move.
