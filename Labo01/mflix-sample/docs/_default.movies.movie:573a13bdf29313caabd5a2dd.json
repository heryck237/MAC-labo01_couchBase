Gabita (Laura Vasliu) is almost five months into an unwanted pregnancy and in meek desperation turns to her friend and roommate, Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) for help in organizing an illegal termination. Unfortunate circumstances force the two women to use a male abortionist, Bebe (Vlad Ivanor), who, in addition to an absurd amount of money, also demands sex with both women as payment. The bleakness of the storyline expresses a dark socio-political critique in the twilight years of a repressive dictatorship.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1032846, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 42459}, "languages": ["Romanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:52:47.210000000", "metacritic": 97, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A woman assists her friend in arranging an illegal abortion in 1980s Romania.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzU1YWUzNjYtNmVhZi00ODUyLTg4M2ItMTFlMmU1Mzc5OTE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1189728000000, "runtime": 113, "title": "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.9M", "consensus": "Featuring gut-wrenching performances from Anamaria Marinca and Laura Vasiliu, 4 Months is a gripping portrayal of life in Communist Romania.", "critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 133, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1213660800000, "fresh": 127, "lastUpdated": 1440965477000, "production": "IFC First Take", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 26182, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.4months3weeksand2days.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cristian Mungiu", "Razvan Radulescu (script consultant)"], "year": 2007}
