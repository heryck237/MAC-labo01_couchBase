Jane was by far the most famous when she performed with their father in vaudeville but as they got older, it was Blanche who became the finer actress, which Jane still resents. Blanche is now confined to a wheelchair - Jane ran her over with the car while drunk, even though she has no memory of it - and Jane is firmly in control. As time goes by, Jane exercises greater and greater control over her sister, intercepting her letters and ensuring that few if anyone from the outside has any contact with her. As Jane slowly loses her mind, she torments her sister going to ever greater extremes.", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 56687, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 27927}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:55:22.417000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A former child star torments her crippled sister in a decaying Hollywood mansion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI0M2VmNTgtMWVhYS00Zjg1LTk1YTYtNmJmMjRkZmMwYTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -226281600000, "runtime": 134, "title": "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 46, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 875145600000, "fresh": 42, "lastUpdated": 1441912562000, "production": "Warner Bros.
