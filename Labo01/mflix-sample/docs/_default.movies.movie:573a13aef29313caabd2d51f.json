The final performance at the Hudson Theatre (which is not technically a Broadway house though it's in the midtown theatre district) will be filmed live for HBO. In the show, Maher addresses contemporary political, social and cultural topics -- Iraq, President Bush and the so called Axis of Evil. The opinionated Maher said about Victory Begins at Home: \"We've heard everything about the War on Terrorism except what we can actually do to help win it. The government used to do that for us through propaganda (the positive kind) posters, so taking my cue from the great old posters of World War I and World War II ('Loose Lips Sink Ships,' 'Buy War Bonds,' 'Plant a Victory Garden,' etc.) I commissioned artists to paint the posters our government today should be putting out to help us win this war.\"", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 377515, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 697}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:00:26.447000000", "plot": "Bill Maher stars in his sixth HBO stand-up special, premiering LIVE from the Hudson Theater in New York!", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxOTU1MzEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkxOTkwMzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1058572800000, "runtime": 60, "title": "Bill Maher: Victory Begins at Home", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Maher"], "year": 2003}
