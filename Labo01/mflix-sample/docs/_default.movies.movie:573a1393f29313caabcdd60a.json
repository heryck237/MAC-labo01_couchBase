He unwraps one at a time, and each takes him on an adventure. The first is a movie projector with a film about the birds of South America; Donald watches two cartoons, one tells of a penguin who longs to live on a tropical isle and the other about a gaucho boy who hunts the wild ostrich. The second gift is a pop-up book about Brazil. Inside is Jose Carioca, who takes Donald to Brazil's Bahia for a mix of animation and live action: the two cartoon birds sing and dance with natives. The third gift is a pi\u00e8ata, accompanied by Panchito. A ride on a magic serape takes the three amigos singing and dancing across Mexico. \u00e8Ol\u00e8!", "genres": ["Animation", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 38166, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 7828}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:32:26.567000000", "plot": "Donald receives his birthday gifts, which include traditional gifts and information about Brazil (hosted by Z\u00e8 Carioca) and Mexico (by Panchito, a Mexican Charro Rooster).", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYzMmFmNjYtYzJmMy00ZGViLTlkNjItYjMwYzA3ZjRkZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjI1Mjk4MTg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -785980800000, "runtime": 71, "title": "The Three Caballeros", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "One of Disney's more abstract creations, The Three Caballeros is a dazzling, colorful picture that shows the company at an artistic acme.", "critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 16, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 957225600000, "fresh": 14, "lastUpdated": 1440353984000, "production": "Walt Disney Home Video", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 12085, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Homer Brightman (story)", "Ernest Terrazas (story)", "Ted Sears (story)", "Bill Peet (story)", "Ralph Wright (story)", "Elmer Plummer (story)", "Roy Williams (story)", "William Cottrell (story)", "Del Connell (story)", "James Bodrero (story)"], "year": 1944}
