Beauty Day is a rambunctious documentary about this irrepressible pioneer of local-access cable shenanigans who entertained and outraged viewers in the small city of St. Catharines-until a special Easter Show, featuring a fat rabbit and adorable puppies (none of which were hurt), got him kicked off the air for good. With a nod to Werner Herzog, Cheel follows the life and times of Cap'n Video and finds that the Cap'n is still quite a firecracker.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1922555, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 320}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:20:29.430000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Before the body-threatening antics of Jackass came crashing into public consciousness, there was Ontario's Ralph Zavadil, aka Cap'n Video, who cascaded off roofs into snowbanks, jumped off ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NTYwNjYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY1MTMzNQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1307664000000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Beauty Day", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437156217000, "production": "FilmBuff", "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 102, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jay Cheel"], "year": 2011}
