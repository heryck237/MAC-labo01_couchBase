Dale gets an offer to play in Paris, where, like many other black American musicians at the time, he enjoys a respect for his humanity that is not based upon the color of his skin. A Parisian man who is obsessed with Turner's music befriends him and attempts to save Turner from himself. Although for Dale the damage is already done, his poignant relationship with the man and his young daughter re-kindles his spirit and his music as the end draws near.", "genres": ["Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 90557, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 3526}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:45:21.543000000", "plot": "In 'Round Midnight, real-life jazz legend Dexter Gordon brilliantly portrays the fictional tenor sax player Dale Turner, a musician slowly losing the battle with alcoholism, estranged from ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzBlNThhNTctYmE4YS00YzM5LWEwZTAtODlkN2IyNWYwOWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 528681600000, "runtime": 133, "title": "'Round Midnight", "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Rayfiel (screenplay)", "Bertrand Tavernier (screenplay)", "Colo Tavernier (French translation)"], "year": 1986}
