Jackass characters Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) and Billy (Jackson Nicoll) will take movie audiences along for the most insane hidden camera road trip ever captured on camera. Along the way Irving will introduce the young and impressionable Billy to people, places, and situations that give new meaning to the term \"childrearing\". The duo will encounter male strippers, disgruntled child beauty pageant contestants (and their equally disgruntled mothers), funeral home mourners, biker bar patrons, and a whole lot of unsuspecting citizens. Real people in unreal situations, making for one really messed up comedy.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 3063516, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 72552}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:25:27.847000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "86-year-old Irving Zisman takes a trip from Nebraska to North Carolina to take his 8 year-old grandson, Billy, back to his real father.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NjIwMTI5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjU1MTMyMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1382659200000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$102.0M", "consensus": "Never quite as funny as it wants to be, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa still offers viewers the timeless pleasures of seeing an old man get his privates stuck in a vending machine.", "critic": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 105, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 1390867200000, "fresh": 63, "lastUpdated": 1442081598000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 42, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 103642, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.BadGrandpa.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Johnny Knoxville (screenplay)", "Spike Jonze (screenplay)", "Jeff Tremaine (screenplay)", "Johnny Knoxville (story)", "Spike Jonze (story)", "Jeff Tremaine (story)", "Fax Bahr (story)", "Adam Small (story)"], "year": 2013}
