After their latest conversation lamenting about the lack of suitable men in Eastwick and describing the qualities they are looking for in a man, mysterious Daryl Van Horne and his equally mysterious butler Fidel arrive in town. Despite being vulgar, crude, brazen and not particularly handsome, Daryl manages to be able to tap into the innermost emotions of the three friends, and as such manages to seduce each. In turn, the three women blossom emotionally and sexually. After an incident involving one of the town's leading citizens, the ultra conservative Felicia Alden, the three women begin to understand how and why Daryl is able to mesmerize them so fully. The three decide to experiment with some powers learned indirectly from Daryl so that they can hopefully regain control of their own lives.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 94332, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 44292}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:04:34.037000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Three single women in a picturesque village have their wishes granted - at a cost - when a mysterious and flamboyant man arrives in their lives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4ZGRlNDEtNDliMi00NmI0LThlYjctYmViMjI0MDlmOWU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 550454400000, "runtime": 118, "title": "The Witches of Eastwick", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A wickedly funny tale of three witches and their duel with the Devil, fuelled by some delicious fantasy and arch comedic performances.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 26, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 872640000000, "fresh": 19, "lastUpdated": 1440185298000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 65689, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Updike (novel)", "Michael Cristofer"], "year": 1987}
