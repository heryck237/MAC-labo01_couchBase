Dale hates his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, because she makes unwelcome sexual advances when he's about to get married. But Dale is on that pesky list of child offenders so he can't quit. Kurt actually likes his job and his boss, well, up until his boss dies and the boss's coked-out, psychopathic son takes over. But who would be crazy enough to quit their jobs in such poor economic times? Instead Nick, Dale and Kurt drunkenly and hypothetically discuss how to kill their bosses, and before they know it, they've hired a murder consultant to help them pull off the three deeds.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1499658, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 327209}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:18:58.200000000", "metacritic": 57, "plot": "Three friends conspire to murder their awful bosses when they realize they are standing in the way of their happiness.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYxNDI5Njc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUxODE1NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1310083200000, "runtime": 98, "title": "Horrible Bosses", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$117.5M", "consensus": "It's nasty, uneven, and far from original, but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise, Horrible Bosses works.", "critic": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 207, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1318291200000, "fresh": 142, "lastUpdated": 1442081930000, "production": "Warner Bros.
