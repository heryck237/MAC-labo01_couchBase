She and her brother Diego made up the band Groenlandia, whose first album was a huge hit. But Lupe has turned her back on that distant past of touring and concerts. She lives wholly dependent on her mother Paquita (65) and has a teenage son, Pancho(14), who hates her. Her agoraphobia won't even let her leave the house to buy the ingredients she needs for cooking. Luckily her mother, Paquita, a superstitious Mexican woman with a heart of gold,is there to do the shopping, deal with her frequent crises and do what matters most: be a mother to Pancho. But Paquita is running out of time. She just found out that she's going to die and she has only one final goal: to prepare her family for life without her.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 2515214, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 303}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:24:49.880000000", "num_mflix_comments": 5, "plot": "Ever since her brother died, Lupe has lived an agoraphobic life at odds with her teenage son and her superstitious Mexican mother.
