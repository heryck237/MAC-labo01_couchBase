Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh, on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sherrif Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 477348, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 547160}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:01:16.440000000", "metacritic": 91, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5Njk3MjM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc5MTE1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1195603200000, "runtime": 122, "title": "No Country for Old Men", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$74.2M", "consensus": "Bolstered by powerful lead performances from Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, No Country for Old Men finds the Coen brothers spinning cinematic gold out of Cormac McCarthy's grim, darkly funny novel.", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 265, "rating": 8.7}, "dvd": 1239062400000, "fresh": 247, "lastUpdated": 1442079916000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 18, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 393491, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.nocountryforoldmen-themovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joel Coen (screenplay)", "Ethan Coen (screenplay)", "Cormac McCarthy (novel)"], "year": 2007}
