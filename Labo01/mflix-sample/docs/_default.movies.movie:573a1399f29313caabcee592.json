The Japanese contributed to the development of the island and its social infrastructure, leaving behind efficient and popular education and health-care systems. Conversely, Wen-Jian is typical of the sons born to Sega's generation. Born and raised under Chinese government, their natural allegiance is to Chinese culture. They are inevitably mystified by and impatient with their parents' fondness for Japanese culture and rule, their bafflement intensified by all they are taught about Japanese imperialist ambitions and wartime atrocities. Tjos os a generational conundrum with no solution, doubtless unique to Taiwan.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 109691, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 133}, "languages": ["Mandarin", "Min Nan", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-12 00:38:29.073000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Autobiographical story about the life of a poor family in the Taiwanese countryside during the 1940s and 1950s as the Japanese rule of the island ends and nationalist forces of Kwomintang arrive when the Communists take the mainland.", "released": 809395200000, "runtime": 167, "title": "A Borrowed Life", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439925838000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 10, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Nien-Jen Wu"], "year": 1994}
