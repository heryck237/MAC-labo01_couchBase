Organized in an inward-facing circle and unable to move, they quickly learn that every two minutes, one of them must die... executed by a strange device in the center of the room. At first, the attacks seem random, but soon the strangers realize that they, as a group, have the power to decide who will be the next to be killed. A vote. A chance to control the machine. But how can they choose who deserves to die? And what happens when there's only one person left? Circle is a film about people, how they value one another, and what they do under the worst possible circumstances. A film about what makes us human - who we are, what we believe, and ultimately, the lengths we will go to save ourselves.", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 3118452, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 26}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:53:40.513000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Held captive and faced with their imminent executions, fifty strangers are forced to choose the one person among them who deserves to live.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mjg0MjUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk0NzQ4NzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1432771200000, "runtime": 87, "title": "Circle", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Aaron Hann", "Mario Miscione"], "year": 2015}
