The film takes us into the work of a former sexually exploited youth-turned-activist named Rachel Lloyd, who started the New York City organization GEMS (Girls Educational and Mentoring Services) to help victimized young women escape their pimps and find another way of life. We meet teen aged girls at different stages of this transition. Some have been so psychologically manipulated by their pimps that they feel compelled to return. Others have successfully broken with their pasts. As we come to know these girls better, they emerge as well-rounded individuals full of unexpected laughter and insight. One chilling element the film uncovers is a videotape - confiscated by police - of two pimps recording their activities with the intent of making a reality television show. Later we see Lloyd get recognized for her work at a human rights awards ceremony shortly after the song \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" wins an Academy Award.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 1097268, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 373}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-11 00:34:14.963000000", "plot": "Very Young Girls, whose title reflects the fact that in the United States the average age of entry into prostitution is just thirteen.
