Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, and is forced to live underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic (who he's told was spread by a mysterious \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\") and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.", "genres": ["Mystery", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 114746, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 420302}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:45:05.087000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In a future world devastated by disease, a convict is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y2OWU4MWMtNmIyMy00YzMyLWI0Y2ItMTcyZDc3MTdmZDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 820800000000, "runtime": 129, "title": "Twelve Monkeys", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The plot's a bit of a jumble, but excellent performances and mind-blowing plot twists make 12 Monkeys a kooky, effective experience.", "critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 891302400000, "fresh": 52, "lastUpdated": 1441131305000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 388549, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Chris Marker (film La Jet\u00e8e)", "David Webb Peoples (screenplay)", "Janet Peoples (screenplay)"], "year": 1995}
