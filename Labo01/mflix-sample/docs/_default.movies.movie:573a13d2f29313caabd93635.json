After moving to NYC from rural Maine, filmmaker Ian Cheney asks a simple question - do we need the stars? - taking him from Brooklyn to Mauna Kea, Paris, and beyond. Exploring the threat of killer asteroids in Hawaii, tracking hatching turtles along the Florida coast, and rescuing injured birds on Chicago streets, Cheney unravels the myriad implications of a globe glittering with lights - including increased breast cancer rates from exposure to light at night, and a generation of kids without a glimpse of the universe above. Featuring stunning astrophotography and a cast of eclectic scientists, THE CITY DARK is the definitive story of light pollution and the disappearing stars.", "genres": ["Documentary", "News"], "imdb": {"id": 1863406, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 245}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:11:16.690000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "THE CITY DARK is a feature documentary about the loss of night.
