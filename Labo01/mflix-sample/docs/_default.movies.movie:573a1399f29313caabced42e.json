While many attempt to flee the city, Dr Bernard Rieux sends his sick wife away and does his best to care for the plague's victims.

To religious leaders, it's punishment for sins. As the sense of isolation and hopelessness grow, Dr Rieux and his associates begin to question their previously-accepted feelings of justice, loneliness, and love.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 105127, "rating": 6, "votes": 682}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 00:51:57.477000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the 1990s, a South American city is rocked by the imminent outbreak of a plague.
