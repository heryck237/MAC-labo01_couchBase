Topper is also secretly in love with a girl by the name of Sille. One day, Topper finds a pencil with which he writes \"I love Sille\" on a wall. When he discovers that Sille is approaching him, he stands in front of what he has written, so that she will not see it, since he's too shy to show it to her. However, she demands to see what he has written and he is forced to show her. But the writing is gone and he starts to wonder if there is something magic with the pencil. He and viggo decides to really try it out and they draw a rhinoceros on the wall (covered with yellow wallpaper) in Topper's apartment. However, the rhino doesn't vansih, as they think it will, but it comes to life instead. They name him Otto, but keeping him on the third floor in an apartment isn't easy.
