Though he long ago lost his ability to taste, Martin still lives to cook incredibly lavish dinners for his loved ones and to serve them in a family-style ritual at traditional sit-down meals. Although the women humor their father's old-fashioned ways, each of them is searching for fulfillment outside the family circle. College student Maribel is growing increasingly frustrated with the singles scene and wants a steady man; gorgeous career woman Carmen is fed up with her boyfriend and his wandering eye; meanwhile, eldest daughter Letitia, who has suppressed her own romantic longings, senses something missing in her life. Things take a turn for the romantic when Dad, a widower, meets a vivacious divorcee on the lookout for a mate and each of his daughters, in turn, finds someone. But they'll all discover that the recipe for happiness may call for some unexpected ingredients.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 255653, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 3389}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:41:22.407000000", "metacritic": 58, "plot": "A Mexican-American master chef and father to three daughters has lost his taste for food but not for life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJhMmZkOWYtZDI5MC00ODM3LTg5N2ItODhiMDk3NDM0YWUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE4NzUxNDA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 999216000000, "runtime": 102, "title": "Tortilla Soup", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$2.9M", "consensus": "An English remake of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman, Tortilla Soup is as charming and flavorful as the dishes it features.", "critic": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1011052800000, "fresh": 53, "lastUpdated": 1442082816000, "production": "Samuel Goldwyn Films", "rotten": 19, "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 5117, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.surlatable.com/tortillasoup"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hui-Ling Wang (earlier screenplay)", "Ang Lee (earlier screenplay)", "James Schamus (earlier screenplay)", "Ram\u00e8n Men\u00e8ndez (screenplay)", "Tom Musca (screenplay)", "Vera Blasi (screenplay)"], "year": 2001}
