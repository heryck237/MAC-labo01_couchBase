They are 14 years old and live in Dubrovnik: Eta with her mother and grandmother, Linda with her father, who is a heart specialist at the local hospital and once lived in Switzerland, where Linda was born. The two girls are inseparable, although they often are drawn into fierce arguments. Together, they sneak into discos, fight over boys, and dream about an exciting future beyond their quaint hometown. One of their favorite places is the pine forest of Petka Hill on the outskirts of the city. On the first warm spring day, Eta and Linda retreat to a secret beach beneath the cliffs of Petka Hill.
