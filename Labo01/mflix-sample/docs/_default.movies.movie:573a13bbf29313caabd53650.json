Three Korean gunslingers are in Manchuria circa World War II: Do-wan, an upright bounty hunter, Chang-yi, a thin-skinned and ruthless killer, and Tae-goo, a train robber with nine lives. Tae-goo finds a map he's convinced leads to buried treasure; Chang-yi wants it as well for less clear reasons. Do-wan tracks the map knowing it will bring him to Chang-yi, Tae-goo, and reward money. Occupying Japanese forces and their Manchurian collaborators also want the map, as does the Ghost Market Gang who hangs out at a thieves' bazaar. These enemies cross paths frequently and dead bodies pile up. Will anyone find the map's destination and survive to tell the tale?", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 901487, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 24066}, "languages": ["Korean", "Mandarin", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:28:40.853000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of two outlaws and a bounty hunter in 1940s Manchuria and their rivalry to possess a treasure map while being pursued by the Japanese army and Chinese bandits.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM3MmZkZGUtNWE2YS00OTBhLWIwN2MtYTYyNjkwNzkwZmM4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1216252800000, "runtime": 130, "title": "The Good, the Bad, the Weird", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Whilst never taking itself too seriously, this riotous and rollicking Sergio Leone-inspired Korean Western is serious fun.", "critic": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 64, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1282003200000, "fresh": 54, "lastUpdated": 1440182337000, "production": "MPI Media Group", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 14780, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/the-good-the-bad-the-weird"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jee-woon Kim (screenplay)", "Min-suk Kim (screenplay)"], "year": 2008}
