Their jobs are as \"sniper\" and \"spotter\", the spotter is the team lead (as is accurate military protocol). Their assignment is to extract two captives, an ally, and a local. The characters are 1. Rabbits (contractors), and 2. Camels (locals). Rabbits seem to have been chosen due to the Japanese word for Rabbit is Usagi, which can be interpreted to be U.S.A. GI. The Team must interpret the situation, and decide whether to extract the victims themselves or wait for further support. Things seem to be moving rapidly in a negative direction, so the Team elects to split up, and do the extraction themselves. They split up, with Packy going into a village to locate and pull the victims out, and Botasky providing over-watch and sniping support. The fighting is rapid, and smooth, with Packy showing a great deal of speed and agility. The sniping is rapid and smooth. Packy's weapon transfers are perfect. His shooting is controlled and precise, no wasted spray and pray mag dumps. The enemy gets ground support, which complicates things, Botasky is located and shut down as a sniper, and the rescue seems to be compromised, until the Team gets it's own Air Support.", "genres": ["Animation", "Short", "Action"], "imdb": {"id": 2368669, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 897}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 02:12:04.460000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Botasky and Packy are private contractors, working in the Middle East, with support from a distant helicopter-mobile base.
