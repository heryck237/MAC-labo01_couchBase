A charismatic priest, Father Flynn, is trying to upend the school's strict customs, which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the iron-gloved Principal who believes in the power of fear-based discipline. The winds of political change are sweeping through the community, and indeed, the school has just accepted its first black student, Donald Miller. But when Sister James, a hopeful innocent, shares with Sister Aloysius her guilt-inducing suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald, Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now, without a shard of proof besides her moral certainty, Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with irrevocable consequences.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 918927, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 93488}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:12:35.273000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A Catholic school principal questions a priest's ambiguous relationship with a troubled young student.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NDk0NzE4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk1NDE4MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1230163200000, "runtime": 104, "title": "Doubt", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$33.4M", "consensus": "Doubt succeeds on the strength of its top-notch cast, who successfully guide the film through the occasional narrative lull.", "critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 207, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1239062400000, "fresh": 162, "lastUpdated": 1442251875000, "production": "Miramax", "rotten": 45, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 161697, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://doubt-themovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Patrick Shanley (screenplay)", "John Patrick Shanley (play)"], "year": 2008}
