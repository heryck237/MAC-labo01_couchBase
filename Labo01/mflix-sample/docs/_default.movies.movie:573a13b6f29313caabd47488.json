Cameron is a volatile teen who commits grand theft auto just because the car is an exact replica from Christine. Their relationship is forged in the darkness of a movie theater and fueled by a mutual appreciation of rebellion and cinema. Cameron enters a student film contest, though he lacks the resources of his peers. Learning that Flash is a retired Hollywood gaffer-and the only surviving crew member from Citizen Kane-Cameron follows him to his home at the Motion Picture Residence for the Elderly, a colony of aging film folk set aside by the industry. A quirky fellowship develops, in which Flash and his friends help Cameron make his film, and, in doing so, change his life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 489225, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1460}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-30 00:33:33.927000000", "metacritic": 44, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Christopher Plummer plays Flash, a curmudgeon with a hankering for classic movies and booze.
