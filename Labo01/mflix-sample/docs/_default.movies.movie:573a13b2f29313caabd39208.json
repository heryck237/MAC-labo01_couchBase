He shaves it off anyway, but when he sees his wife, she doesn't notice, neither do their friends at dinner that night, neither do his co-workers.

His wife and co-workers are appalled, what is he talking about, he's never had a mustache. In fact, he's imagining other things as well, or is he?", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 428856, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 3821}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Cantonese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:52:37.347000000", "metacritic": 71, "plot": "Marc is sitting in his bath one morning and asks his wife, \"how would you feel if I shaved off my mustache?\" She doesn't think it's a great idea, for the 15 years they've been married, ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTUwODY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwOTkzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1120608000000, "runtime": 87, "title": "La moustache", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Though the premise may be modest on the surface, Carrere uses a man and his mustache that may or may not exist as a springboard into psychological suspense and unsettling questions.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 41, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1168905600000, "fresh": 35, "lastUpdated": 1437503595000, "production": "Cinema Guild", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 4144, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.cinemaguild.com/lamoustache"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["J\u00e8r\u00e8me Beaujour", "Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re (novel)", "Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re (screenplay)"], "year": 2005}
