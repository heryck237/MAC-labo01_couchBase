Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1136608, "rating": 8, "votes": 494849}, "languages": ["English", "Nyanja", "Afrikaans", "Zulu", "Xhosa", "Southern Sotho"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:29:09.253000000", "metacritic": 81, "num_mflix_comments": 408, "plot": "An extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth suddenly finds a kindred spirit in a government agent who is exposed to their biotechnology.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5MzFjYWMtMTMwNC00ZGU5LWI3YTQtYzhkMGExNGFlY2Q0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1250208000000, "runtime": 112, "title": "District 9", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$115.6M", "consensus": "Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 291, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1261440000000, "fresh": 261, "lastUpdated": 1442163640000, "production": "Sony Pictures/Screen Gems", "rotten": 30, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 1175625, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.d-9.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Neill Blomkamp", "Terri Tatchell"], "year": 2009}
