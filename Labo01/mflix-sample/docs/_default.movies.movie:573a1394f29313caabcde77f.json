The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east---specifically Peru---rather than from the west (Asia)as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific, and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered, set out on the voyage.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 42650, "rating": 8, "votes": 1646}, "languages": ["Norwegian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:49:49.250000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A documentary about the Kon-Tiki expedition of the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM1YjA5ZDYtZmU5ZC00NGIxLThiM2MtMjg1YmYxZGNjY2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -630115200000, "runtime": 77, "title": "Kon-Tiki", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 978393600000, "lastUpdated": 1440441734000, "production": "Janson Media", "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 620, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thor Heyerdahl"], "year": 1950}
