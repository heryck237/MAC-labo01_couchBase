Stunned by Pearl Harbor and a string of defeats, America needed a victory - badly. To that end, Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, a former air racer and stunt pilot, devises a plan for a daring raid on the heart of Japan itself. To do this, he must train army bomber pilots to do something no one ever dreamed possible - launch 16 fully loaded bombers from an aircraft carrier! Remarkable in its accuracy, this movie even uses film footage from the actual raid.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 37366, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3822}, "languages": ["English", "Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:17:30.113000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In the wake of Pearl Harbor, a young lieutenant leaves his expectant wife to volunteer for a secret bombing mission which will take the war to the Japanese homeland.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZmZjg1ZDAtY2VkYi00YTY1LWFmMzQtNjc4NmZmNmE1MjQxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -794188800000, "runtime": 138, "title": "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1181001600000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1441131180000, "production": "MGM Home Entertainment", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 676, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dalton Trumbo (screen play)", "Ted W.
