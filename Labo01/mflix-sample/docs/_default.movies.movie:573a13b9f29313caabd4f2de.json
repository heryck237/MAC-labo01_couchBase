January, 1986. Campbell Babbitt is a reporter for the New York World, writing a series on a woman who turned the grief of losing a son into civic acts. He falls in love with her, and when she commits suicide, he continues to write made-up stories about her. His editor sends him to New Hampshire to cover the Challenger flight from the town of teacher Christa McAuliffe. The launch is postponed for a few days, giving Campbell time to get to know a group of misfit students whose own teacher killed himself the day Campbell arrives in town. He pieces the story together that led to the suicide, finds himself attracted to a student, and has to sort out his own loss.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 832318, "rating": 5.7, "votes": 1622}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-09 00:21:55.117000000", "metacritic": 22, "plot": "Set in the mid-80's when a reporter is sent to cover the Challenger Space Shuttle launch only to become mixed up in the lives of some local students.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5Mzg4Njg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc1NDE1Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1243555200000, "runtime": 104, "title": "What Goes Up", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "What Goes Up squanders the charisma of Steve Coogan with a lazy screenplay, contrived plotting, and overall poor production.", "critic": {"meter": 16, "numReviews": 31, "rating": 3.5}, "dvd": 1245110400000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1439494263000, "production": "Three Kings", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 32, "numReviews": 12048, "rating": 2.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jonathan Glatzer", "Robert C.
