He lives in Paris and speaks no French. Since his wife's death, he's marking time. His curiosity is piqued when he meets Pauline Laubie, half his age, a dance instructor. She's also a solitary person but wants the connection of family. She believes she's found that in Matthew, and she attends to him during a hospitalization. When his two adult children arrive from the U.S. to check on their father, they are certain Pauline is a gold digger, and she's confounded by the distance between father and children. The daughter heads home, the son remains. Is there any way that Pauline fits in?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1838603, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 8030}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:19:08.893000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "He's a widower in Paris who speaks no French; she's a dance instructor less than half his age.
