A village teacher in Iran tries to explain to her young students what's happened. City kids in Burkina Faso think they've spotted Osama bin Laden. A deaf Frenchwoman in Manhattan writes a Dear John letter to a man who has left that morning for work at the World Trade Center. A Chilean remembers Allende. Events recall other deaths. A mother endures more than her son's death. And so on. The tone varies, as do the locales. Most stories are about others coming to terms with the events of the day, but at least one confronts the viewer with tragedy and death.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 328802, "rating": 7, "votes": 4698}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French", "Arabic", "Hebrew", "Persian", "French Sign Language", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 05:07:04.840000000", "metacritic": 61, "plot": "The effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks are told from different points of view around the world.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMjI4MjYtNjYzMC00ZTE1LWJlNjAtNWIyYzU3Njc3ODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1031702400000, "runtime": 134, "title": "September 11", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 58, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1098748800000, "fresh": 45, "lastUpdated": 1442266858000, "production": "Empire Pictures", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 631, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.empirepicturesusa.com/ep/show_movie.asp?title=10019"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Youssef Chahine (segment)", "Sabrina Dhawan (segment)", "Amos Gitai (segment)", "Alejandro Gonz\u00e8lez I\u00e8\u00e8rritu (segment)", "Paul Laverty (segment)", "Claude Lelouch (segment)", "Ken Loach (segment)", "Samira Makhmalbaf (segment)", "Idrissa Ouedraogo (segment)", "Sean Penn (segment)", "Marie-Jose Sanselme (segment)", "Danis Tanovic (segment)", "Daisuke Tengan (segment)", "Pierre Uytterhoeven (segment)", "Vladimir Vega (segment)"], "year": 2002}
