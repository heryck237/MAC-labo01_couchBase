Marcos steps in, claiming to be a policeman, and drags Juan out of the store. Once they are back on the street, Marcos reveals himself to be a fellow swindler with a game of much higher stakes in mind, and he invites Juan to be his partner in crime. A once-in-a-lifetime scheme seemingly falls into their laps - an old-time con man enlists them to sell a forged set of extremely valuable rare stamps, The Nine Queens. The tricky negotiations that ensue bring into the picture a cast of suspicious characters, including Marcos' sister Valeria, their younger brother Federico and a slew of thieves, conmen and pickpockets. As the deceptions mount, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out who is conning whom.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 247586, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 34921}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 04:11:16.877000000", "metacritic": 80, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two con artists try to swindle a stamp collector by selling him a sheet of counterfeit rare stamps (the \"nine queens\").", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDdlYjItMDVkYy00MjYzLThhMTYtYjIzZjZiODk1ZWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 967680000000, "runtime": 114, "title": "Nine Queens", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.1M", "consensus": "Deliciously twist-filled, Nine Queens is a clever and satisfying crime caper.", "critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 93, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 1033430400000, "fresh": 86, "lastUpdated": 1442434409000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 13575, "rating": 4.2}, "website": "http://www.magiclanternpr.com/films/Nine_Queens.htm"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Fabi\u00e8n Bielinsky"], "year": 2000}
