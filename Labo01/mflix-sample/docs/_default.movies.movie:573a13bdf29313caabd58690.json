The tale she spins---and the movie we watch---is a wild, surreal adventure in which people are able to project and enter each other's dreams, and our heroine is sold into slavery and lands in a swank, debauched Liverpool brothel where the patrons enact their literary/sexual fantasies with Lolita, St. Joan, and Desdemona. Rendered with dazzling tracking shots, striking CGI effects and a pulsing soundtrack, Hungarian director Szabolcs Hajdu's risk-taking fantasia has style to spare. But under the seductive surface lurks the very human story of a woman who uses fantasy to cushion the pain of life.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 997035, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1352}, "languages": ["Romanian", "English", "Hungarian", "Spanish", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:04:47.080000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In order to regain custody of her daughter, whom she left in the care of her fortune-telling aunt, Mona must tell a social worker her story.
