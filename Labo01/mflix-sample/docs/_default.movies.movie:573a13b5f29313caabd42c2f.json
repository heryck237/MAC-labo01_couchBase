Schwartzwalder recruits Davis with the help of All-American running back, Jim Brown. The civil rights movement is gaining steam; Davis experiences prejudice on campus, in town, and on the field, sometimes from teammates. How he handles it and how he challenges Schwartzwalder to stand up for his players provide a counterpoint to several great seasons that lead first to a national championship and then to the Heismann Trophy.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 469903, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 15644}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:38:32", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 429, "plot": "A drama based on the life of college football hero Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTY5OTA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5ODk3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1223596800000, "runtime": 130, "title": "The Express", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$9.6M", "consensus": "This inspirational sports biopic set in the the civil rights era is interesting even for non-football fans, and features a great performance by Dennis Quaid as tough-but-fair football coach.", "critic": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 115, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1232409600000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1442165969000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 45, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 820103, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.theexpressmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Charles Leavitt", "Robert Gallagher (book)"], "year": 2008}
