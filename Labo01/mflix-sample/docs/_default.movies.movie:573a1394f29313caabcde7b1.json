He falls in love with the ingenue, Liliana, and ignores his companion of several years, Melina Amour. (She wants to marry Checco and she's saving to open a deli.) Also, believing he can be an impresario, he hires other actors and begins rehearsal for a revue that will star Liliana and himself. Liliana admires Checco, but she's being squired around town by Adelmo Conti, the assistant to the region's biggest impresario. Can Checco's new troupe hold onto Liliana, and how will Melina fare?", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 42692, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1803}, "languages": ["Italian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 08:12:32.657000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A beautiful but ambitious young woman joins a traveling troupe of third-rate vaudevillians and inadvertently causes jealousy and emotional crises.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNDhhOGQtODk4OC00ODQxLWE4ZWMtMDY1NzBjZGU5OWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzcwMDAzMzk@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -601862400000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Variety Lights", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 8}, "dvd": 1268092800000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1438369644000, "production": "Path\u00e8 Contemporary Films", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 566, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Federico Fellini (screenplay)", "Federico Fellini (story)", "Alberto Lattuada (screenplay)", "Tullio Pinelli (screenplay)"], "year": 1950}
