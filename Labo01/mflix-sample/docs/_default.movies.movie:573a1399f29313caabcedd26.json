He was a university professor until an air raid, when he left to become a writer and has to live in a hut. His mood has hardly changed, not by the change nor by time. Every year his students celebrate his birthday, issuing the question \"Mahda kai?\" (not yet?), just to hear Uehida-san's answer \"Madada yo!\" (No, not yet!), in a ritual of self affirmation, and desires of lasting forever. It's a very \"japanese\" film who portrays everyday life and customs in Japan.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 107474, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3215}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-30 00:25:36.427000000", "metacritic": 76, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Following World War II, a retired professor approaching his autumn years finds his quality of life drastically reduced in war-torn Tokyo.
