She's the president of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, Miss June in her campus calendar, and, above all, a natural blonde. She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner (Matthew Davis) from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. Growing up across the street from Aaron Spelling might mean something in LA, but nothing to Warner's East-Coast blue blood family. So, when Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. But law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside and the mall. Elle must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes who suffer endless indignities everyday.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 250494, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 117807}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 02:49:27.467000000", "metacritic": 59, "plot": "When a blonde sorority queen is dumped by her boyfriend, she decides to follow him to law school to get him back and, once there, learns she has more legal savvy than she ever imagined.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyNjUwMTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk0NDk0NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 994982400000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Legally Blonde", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1138665600000, "lastUpdated": 1442338321000, "viewer": {"meter": 52, "numReviews": 481, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Amanda Brown (novel)", "Karen McCullah (screenplay)", "Kirsten Smith (screenplay)"], "year": 2001}
