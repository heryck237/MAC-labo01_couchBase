Desperate, he accepts a proposal from his former military commander (Predrag Manojlovic) to smuggle illegal Syrian immigrants across the border he once had to defend. The road leads across a peak called The Judgment, a place full of dark memories from thousands of years of history, but also from Mityo's own past.
