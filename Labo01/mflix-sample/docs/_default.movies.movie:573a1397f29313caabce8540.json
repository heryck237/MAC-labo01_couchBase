Nothing happens, but his boss gives him four days to solve the hoax. Odd things occur: on day one there's a murder at the combine; vague references to the combine's enemy, Krysmopompas, appear; the nephew of the combine's boss confesses to the bomb threat, although he didn't do it. Jansen stays focused, interviewing employees who received special awards (printed on the paper used for the bomb threat). Is he onto something big or was the bomb threat just a prank? And what is this 31st floor rumored hidden in the 30-story combine headquarters?", "genres": ["Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 84191, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 334}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-04 00:01:30.833000000", "plot": "In a totalitarian society of the future, in which the government controls all facets of the media, a homicide detective investigates a string of bombings, and finds out more than he bargained for.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MDQ1OTEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgzMzUzMDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 395625600000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Kamikaze 89", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1420769159000, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Wolf Gremm", "Robert Katz", "Per Wahl\u00e8\u00e8 (novel)"], "year": 1982}
