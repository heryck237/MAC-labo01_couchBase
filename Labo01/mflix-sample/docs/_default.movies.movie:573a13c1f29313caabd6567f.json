Bigamy, unwanted pregnancy, possible incest and bothersome skin irritations are all part of their daily challenges, but the real \"star\" of the show is an enormous, dilapidated movie theater that doubles as family business and living space. At one time a prestige establishment, the theater now runs porn double bills and serves as a meeting ground for hustlers of every conceivable persuasion. The film captures the sordid, fetid atmosphere, interweaving various family subplots with the comings and goings of customers, thieves and even a runaway goat while enveloping the viewer in a maelstrom of sound, noise and continuous motion.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1225296, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 1048}, "languages": ["Filipino", "Tagalog"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:44:30.593000000", "metacritic": 76, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A drama that follows the travails of the Pineda family in the Filipino city of Angeles.
