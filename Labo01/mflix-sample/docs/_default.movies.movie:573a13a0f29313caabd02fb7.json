Intercut with a 1972 interview of Waters are clips from his first films and recent interviews with his parents, his brother, Divine's mom, actors and crew, other directors, film critics, a film curator, psychologists, and Maryland's last censor, who shudders at the memory of Waters's pictures. Also included is footage of Waters making his early movies, culminating in an up-close and in-depth look at Pink Flamingos: the script, the set, the filming conditions, its editing, its distribution, and its impact. In sweet ways, this documentary is also a celebration of Divine (1945-1988).", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 150338, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 793}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 04:16:14.910000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The life and times of Baltimore film maker and midnight movie pioneer, John Waters.
