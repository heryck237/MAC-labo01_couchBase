However, today's journey is different because of Jacinta, who accompanies him as his passenger all the way to Buenos Aires. What's more, Rub\u00e8n finds out at the very moment that her little Anah\u00e8, who's 8 months old, travels with them. As kilometres go by, the relationship between Rub\u00e8n and Jacinta will grow.
