Alexandra looks into finding holistic treatment and finds Father Grigori Rasputin, a destitute monk who claims he had a vision from the Virgin Mary telling him that the Tsar needed him. Though Nicholas and the royal doctor are both skeptical of Rasputin's alleged healing abilities, young Alexei quickly bonds with the charleton/prophet, so he remains in the Royal Court. But Rasputin's constant boozing and womanizing angers the aristocracy and worsens the already unstable tensions between Nicholas and his subjects. With the seeds of revolution brewing, it becomes increasingly apparent that a bad end awaits for the entire Royal Family.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 117442, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 2555}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:13:13.923000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "HBO biopic about the infamous \"mad monk\" Rasputin from the court of Tsar Nicholas in Russia.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNkOTM2NDYtMTQ2My00YWEwLTgzMDAtMzAwOGIwOWQyYzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTM2MTY3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 827539200000, "runtime": 135, "title": "Rasputin", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 844732800000, "lastUpdated": 1438023309000, "production": "HBO Video", "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 3161, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Peter Pruce"], "year": 1996}
