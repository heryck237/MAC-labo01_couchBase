In 1978, after a divorce, Kinison gives up revival-style preaching to pursue comedy full time. He performs in Houston for several years, then goes to L.A. where he's a maitre d' for the Comedy Store, rarely getting on stage. Then, Rodney Dangerfield gives Sam six minutes on an HBO special, and he's a star. Between the commentary and analysis by Pryor, Miller, Tenuta, Leno, and others are long clips from Kinison's interviews on Larry King Live and from his loud, raunchy, angry, sacred, and profane performances: rock and roll meets standup.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 174180, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 186}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-18 00:07:54.657000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "An examination of the career of the late comedian Sam Kinison.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NjI5MDEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1ODUzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "runtime": 90, "title": "Sam Kinison: Why Did We Laugh?", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1438626350000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 24, "rating": 3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Larry Carroll"], "year": 1998}
