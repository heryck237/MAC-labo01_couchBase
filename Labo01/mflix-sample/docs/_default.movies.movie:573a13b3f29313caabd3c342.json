This magical tragicomic melodrama may be Almodovar's most restrained work to date, but it still features his trademarks: a strong attention to color and detail, a celebration of the trials and tribulations of women, and, of course, the inestimable Carmen Maura. The lovely Penelope Cruz hasn't shone more brightly as she does here.", "critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 161, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1175558400000, "fresh": 148, "lastUpdated": 1440268628000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 71427, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/volver/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Milan Dor (screenplay)", "Christine N\u00e8stlinger (novel)"], "year": 2004}
