More than eight years later, she was at his side when he died. During this entire time, she only entered his room when he rang for her, sleeping from 9 AM to 3 PM to wait during the night while he wrote. Marcel uses her as more than a servant: she is his muse, telling stories of her childhood to stir his remembrance of things past; she's in cahoots with him as he manipulates those he wants to draw on for his writing; she listens appalled to his descriptions of the underside of Paris. Hers is a life of love and sweet devotion as he races time to finish his work before death.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 82225, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 119}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 11:49:56.500000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In 1914, with men gone to war, Marcel Proust hired C\u00e8leste Albaret as his attendant.
