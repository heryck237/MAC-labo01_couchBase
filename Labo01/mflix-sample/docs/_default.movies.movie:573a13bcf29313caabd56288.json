However, Dr. Henry discovers that his wife was carrying twins, and helps her deliver the second child, a baby girl named Phoebe. Shortly after Phoebe's birth, he finds that she has Down Syndrome, and hands her over to Nurse Caroline, explaining that the death of his ill sister nearly destroyed their mother and he doesn't want Norah to go through that. Instead, he instructs Caroline to take Phoebe to a nearby institution for the mentally ill, figuring the child won't live much longer, and tells Norah that Phoebe was a stillborn. However, after visiting the institution and seeing the state of the other patients, Caroline takes the baby home with her, stopping along the way to buy formula and diapers. With help from a truck driver named Al, Caroline begins to raise the baby as her own, while Dr. Henry develops an obsession for photography after his wife gives him the gift of a Memory Keeper camera.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 955298, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 2134}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 00:36:56.873000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A father separates his son from his twin sister at birth to prevent him and the mother from knowing she was born with Down syndrome.
