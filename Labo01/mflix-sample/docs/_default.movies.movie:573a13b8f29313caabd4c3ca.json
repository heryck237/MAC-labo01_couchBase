He just happens to be the hit-man for his Polish mob family in Buffalo, New York. But Frank's got a drinking problem and when he messes up a critical assignment that puts the family business in peril, his uncle sends him to San Francisco to clean up his act. Frank is not a touchy-feely kind of guy, but he starts going to AA meetings, gets a sponsor and a job at a mortuary where he falls for the tart-tongued Laurel, a woman who is dangerously devoid of boundaries. Meanwhile, things aren't going well in Buffalo where an upstart Irish gang is threatening the family business. When violence erupts, Frank is forced to return home and with an unlikely assist from Laurel, faces old rivals on new terms.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 796375, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 15736}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:49:17.853000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "While drying out on the West Coast, an alcoholic hit man befriends a tart-tongued woman who might just come in handy when it's time for him to return to Buffalo and settle some old scores.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyMjg3NDE4MDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDg2NzE4NDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1184284800000, "runtime": 93, "title": "You Kill Me", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$2.3M", "consensus": "Featuring wonderful performances from Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni, You Kill Me is a charming, funny take on the familiar inner-lives-of-hit-men premise.", "critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 114, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1191888000000, "fresh": 89, "lastUpdated": 1440698786000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 25, "viewer": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 30629, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://youkillmethefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Christopher Markus", "Stephen McFeely"], "year": 2007}
