This sociopath has already murdered other good Samaritans in his efforts to evade authorities.

His destination is a ferryboat in Baja, California, which he hopes will help him get to the mainland. The hostages hope to stay alive long enough to escape or be rescued by Mexican authorities.", "genres": ["Crime", "Film-Noir", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 45877, "rating": 7, "votes": 3707}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:20:57.670000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two fishermen pick up a psychotic escaped convict who tells them that he intends to murder them when the ride is over.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3NTY4OWYtNzkzNy00ZGZhLThkMmUtYjM4OTRlNmY0MWI2L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -511574400000, "runtime": 71, "title": "The Hitch-Hiker", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 939859200000, "fresh": 7, "lastUpdated": 1440356335000, "production": "Acme DVD Works", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 1816, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Collier Young (screenplay)", "Ida Lupino (screenplay)", "Robert L.
