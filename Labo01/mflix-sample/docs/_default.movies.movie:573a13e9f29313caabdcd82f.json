James J. Bulger captures the sensational trial of infamous gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, using the legal proceedings as a springboard to explore allegations of corruption within the highest levels of law enforcement. Embedded for months with Federal Prosecutors, retired FBI and State Police, victims, lawyers, gangsters and journalists, Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Joe Berlinger examines Bulger's relationship with the FBI and Department of Justice that allowed him to reign over a criminal empire in Boston for decades. Pulling back the curtain on long-held Bulger mythology, the film challenges conventional wisdom by detailing shocking, new allegations. With unprecedented access, Berlinger's latest crime documentary offers a universal tale of human frailty, opportunism, deception, and the often elusive nature of truth and justice.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 3326366, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 1377}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:34:02.063000000", "metacritic": 74, "plot": "A look at James 'Whitey' Bulger, one of the most infamous criminals in American history.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNDQ4MTA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc4ODU3MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1403827200000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Whitey: United States of America v.
