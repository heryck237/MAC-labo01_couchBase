This film guides you through this fashion pioneer's long career from her youth in Paris until she became a leading magazine fashion columnist and editor. In this medium, Vreeland challenged its preconceptions to present a new definition of beauty and vivaciousness where nice clothes were just the beginning for something deeper. Even when that vocation ended, Vreeland managed to gain a new museum profession to present clothing's history in her own inimitable way.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 2053352, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 874}, "languages": ["English", "French", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 01:00:34.573000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A look at the life and work of the influential fashion editor of Harpers Bazaar, Diana Vreeland.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5NTY3Mzg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzczOTU0OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1348185600000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.0M", "consensus": "An affectionate portrait created with visual flair, Diana Vreeland is entertaining, informative, and stylish, due in large part to its charismatic subject.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 66, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1359936000000, "fresh": 62, "lastUpdated": 1441993477000, "production": "Samuel Goldwyn Films", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 2054, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.dianavreeland.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lisa Immordino Vreeland", "Bent-Jorgen Perlmutt", "Fr\u00e8d\u00e8ric Tcheng"], "year": 2011}
