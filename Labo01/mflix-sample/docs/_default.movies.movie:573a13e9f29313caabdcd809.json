It's a quest through science and consciousness, individual and planetary, exploring our relationships with ourselves, the world around us and the universe as a whole. It demonstrates how connected we really all are, as best expressed in the Mayan greeting In Lak'ech, which means \"I am another yourself.\" It also demonstrates just how unnatural the sense of separation that characterizes much of modern thought really is as opposed to the understanding of unity and oneness found in many ancient traditions. Above all it is a transcendental pilgrimage of repossession and empowerment, affirming our place in the universe and asserting mankind as a conscious mankind with real power as individuals and as a collective to create our reality, leaving us with a message that will not only open our eyes, but will hopefully stimulate everyone into generating a better and brighter tomorrow for the benefit of present and future generations.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 3326110, "rating": 8, "votes": 5}, "languages": ["Spanish", "English", "Italian", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 01:01:24.317000000", "plot": "ANOTHER WORLD is a feature documentary about mankind's journey to discover our true force and who we truly are, challenging the modern view of the world and reconsidering the world view and...", "released": 1394841600000, "runtime": 63, "title": "Un altro mondo", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Valentina Ivana Chiarappa", "Thomas Torelli"], "year": 2014}
