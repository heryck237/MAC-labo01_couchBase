They're shaven and shorn, in black suits to pose as settlers in Tel Aviv for a wedding. Something goes wrong at the crossing, they're separated, and the action is postponed, long enough for renewed questioning of what they're about to do. Suha, the well-educated and well-traveled daughter of a martyr, challenges the action. She likes Said and has her own ideas. \"Under the occupation, we're already dead,\" is Khaled's analysis. Fate and God's will seem to drive Said. We must be moral, argues Suha.
