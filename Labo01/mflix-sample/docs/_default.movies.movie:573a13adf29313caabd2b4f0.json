His sister is a bully, his mom's a doormat, and his dad is a striking factory worker who drinks and plays bingo. At school, Marko is tormented by thuggish fellow students, led by the loutish Levi, the son of a police captain. Marko's teacher of Macedonian, a Bosnian, sees promise in Marko's writing and gives the lad hope that he can someday escape Veles. A chance friendship with a thief who's passing through town furthers Marko's education. Is hope a mirage? What sort of fatherland is Macedonia?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 368962, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 856}, "languages": ["Macedonian", "Albanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:02:43.937000000", "metacritic": 61, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "As Macedonia faces its difficult transition, a boy escapes into a world of his own creation.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTY4NDQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY1MTIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1180483200000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Mirage", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Svetozar Ristovski", "Grace Lea Troje"], "year": 2004}
