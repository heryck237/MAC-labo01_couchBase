Uses contemporary interviews, archival footage, and recreations to tell the story of his previous walks between towers of Notre Dame and of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, his passions and friendships, and the details of the night before the walk: getting cable into the towers, hiding from guards, and mounting the wire. It ends with observations of the profound changes the walk's success brought to Philippe and those closest to him.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1155592, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 33935}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:38:01.417000000", "metacritic": 89, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A look at tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daring, but illegal, high-wire routine performed between New York City's World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974, what some consider, \"the artistic crime of the century.\"", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNTk3NDY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0ODg3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1219968000000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Man on Wire", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$2.6M", "consensus": "James Marsh's doc about artist Phililppe Petit's artful caper brings you every ounce of suspense that can be wrung from a man on a (suspended) wire.", "critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 152, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1228780800000, "fresh": 152, "lastUpdated": 1440180798000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 28061, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.magpictures.com/profile.aspx?id=be7f3311-664f-41fd-a8a8-99b27c37be45"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Philippe Petit (book)"], "year": 2008}
