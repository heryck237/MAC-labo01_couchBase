From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 3268458, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 6630}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:22:34.577000000", "metacritic": 72, "plot": "The story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz, who took his own life at the age of 26.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgwOTgwNjQ5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1NTQ2MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1403827200000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Brian Knappenberger"], "year": 2014}
