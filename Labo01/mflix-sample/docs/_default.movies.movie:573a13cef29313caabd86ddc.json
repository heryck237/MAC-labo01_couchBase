Over the course of a solar jobs training program, Catching the Sun follows the hope and heartbreak of unemployed American workers seeking jobs in the solar industry. An unlikely ensemble of characters contrast with preconceived notions about who is at the forefront of a transition to clean energy. With countries like China investing in innovative technologies and capitalizing on this trillion-dollar opportunity, Catching the Sun tells the story of the global energy transition from the perspective of workers and entrepreneurs building solutions to income inequality and climate change with their own hands. Their successes and failures speak to one of the biggest questions of our time: will the U.S. actually be able to build a clean energy economy?", "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1698654, "rating": "", "votes": ""}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 01:30:44.587000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Through interwoven dramas spanning the U.S. and China, Catching the Sun explores the global economic race to lead the clean energy future.", "released": 1433116800000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Catching the Sun", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1433182745000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 11, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.sparrowfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Shalini Kantayya"], "year": 2015}
