One of the photos is of Nathan as a child, putting into question the identities of the couple whom he's always called Mom and Dad. Contacting the site to learn more only results in Nathan becoming the target of an intense, high-tech, international manhunt. Before his \"parents\" can explain themselves, they are executed by hired guns, and Nathan is on the run with Karen in tow (who just happened to be there at the wrong time). Phone use by either of them only connects directly to a man claiming to be C.I.A., in whom they find reasons not to trust. With encroaching shootouts, car chases, hand-to-hand combat and explosions around them, this seems quite much for a mere case of child abduction, and Nathan can only rely on the wrestling, boxing and martial arts skills taught by his \"dad\" to protect both himself and Karen as they follow a lead to find Martin, Nathan's biological father, who can likely shed light on what all this is about.", "genres": ["Action", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1600195, "rating": 5, "votes": 60924}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:03:41.640000000", "metacritic": 25, "plot": "A thriller centered on a young man who sets out to uncover the truth about his life after finding his baby photo on a missing persons website.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzU3OTg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY5MDY2Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1316736000000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Abduction", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Shawn Christensen"], "year": 2011}
