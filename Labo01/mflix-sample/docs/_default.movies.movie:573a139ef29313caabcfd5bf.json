Demented leads a band of cinema revolutionaries who kidnap Honey Whitlock, a bitchy and aging movie star of big-budget froth. Cecil wants her in his movie, a screed against Hollywood they film during blitzkrieg attacks on a multiplex, a Maryland Film Commission press conference, and the set of a \"Forrest Gump\" sequel. He insists on celibacy; the cast and crew channel sexual energy into the production. With a family-values coalition, aggrieved Teamsters, and the police on their trail, Cecil needs help from porno, kung-fu, and drive-in audiences. What about Honey? Will she bolt or refuse to act? Or will she hit her marks and light up the screen?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 173716, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 11054}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:11:59.640000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An insane independent film director and his renegade group of teenage filmmakers kidnap an A-list Hollywood actress and force her to star in their underground film.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2YzQ4MDMtZmQ5Yi00YjU5LTkyMzUtYzk5NzY3OTFiM2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 967766400000, "runtime": 87, "title": "Cecil B.
