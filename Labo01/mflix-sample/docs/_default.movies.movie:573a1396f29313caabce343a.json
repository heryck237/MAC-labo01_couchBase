Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well).

Now a race begins between computers (HAL) and human (Bowman) to reach the monolith placers. The winner will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.", "genres": ["Mystery", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 62622, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 377539}, "languages": ["English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:02:55.937000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNlYzRiNDctZWNhMi00MzI4LThkZTctMTUzMmZkMmFmNThmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": -51494400000, "runtime": 160, "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.", "critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 70, "rating": 9.2}, "dvd": 904003200000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1442079437000, "production": "Warner Bros.
