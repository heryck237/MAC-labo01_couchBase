Jeff and Joel, lovers and cinema-verit\u00e8 filmmakers, and a friend of theirs named Mark have come out to Michigan to help the dream come true: they're shooting The Demon Lover for Don and Jerry. Two weeks after production starts, Jeff and Joel and Mark are fleeing Michigan, bullets ricocheting off the car, lives and a complete record of the events in jeopardy. The subject of this film isn't just the ups-and-downs of making a horror movie, it's about cultural snobbery, the disintegration of friendship, puppy love, violence, boredom, money... a diary about encountering the Midwest when you're from someplace else.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 206681, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 140}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-03 00:24:35.773000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The film chronicles filmmaker Joel DeMott, significant other/film partner Jeff Kreines and filmmaker Mark Rance as they head to Michigan to make a low budget horror film.", "released": 315532800000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Demon Lover Diary", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437590998000, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 64, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "year": 1980}
