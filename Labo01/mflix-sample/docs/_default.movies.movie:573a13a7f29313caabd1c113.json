They are met by British troops, who are shooting at them, and are trying to forbid them from disembarking. As well, the survivors are met with guns blasts being shot by the Jewish secret army, who has come to help them. Only a small group actually succeeds in landing on the small beach, where they are able to experience their first hours in Palestine. Tired and hungry, the hopeful emigrants have then to follow the Jewish forces to immediately take up arms against the Arabs. Unspoken truths from both sides explode in the violent and tragic conflict.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 304267, "rating": 6, "votes": 578}, "languages": ["Hebrew", "Arabic", "German", "Polish", "Russian", "Yiddish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:32:25.397000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In May 1948, shortly before the creation of the State of Israel, hundreds of immigrants from across Europe arrive in Palestine--only to risk arrest by British troops.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MzQ1NTM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE3MjUyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1022025600000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Kedma", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 4.8}, "dvd": 1084233600000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1437592623000, "production": "Kino International", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 426, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.kino.com/kedma"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Amos Gitai", "Mordechai Goldhecht", "Haim Hazaz (novel)", "Marie-Jose Sanselme", "Taufik Zayad (poem)"], "year": 2002}
