The naive activists ignore the pleas of a scientist to keep the cages locked, with disastrous results. Twenty-eight days later, our protagonist, Jim, wakes up from a coma, alone, in an abandoned hospital. He begins to seek out anyone else to find London is deserted, apparently without a living soul. After finding a church, which had become inhabited by zombie like humans intent on his demise, he runs for his life. Selena and Mark rescue him from the horde and bring him up to date on the mass carnage and horror as all of London tore itself apart. This is a tale of survival and ultimately, heroics, with nice subtext about mankind's savage nature.", "genres": ["Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 289043, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 274502}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 18:06:15.460000000", "metacritic": 73, "plot": "Four weeks after a mysterious, incurable virus spreads throughout the UK, a handful of survivors try to find sanctuary.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFkM2ViMmQtZmI5NS00MjQ2LWEyN2EtMTI1ZmNlZDU3MTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1056672000000, "runtime": 113, "title": "28 Days Later...", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$44.9M", "consensus": "Kinetically directed by Danny Boyle, 28 Days Later is both a terrifying zombie movie and a sharp political allegory.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 219, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1066694400000, "fresh": 190, "lastUpdated": 1442163859000, "production": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "rotten": 29, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 479376, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.28dayslaterthemovie.co.uk/main.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Alex Garland"], "year": 2002}
