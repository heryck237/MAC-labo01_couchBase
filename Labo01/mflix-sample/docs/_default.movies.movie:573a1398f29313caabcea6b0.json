So the man offers to let Preston find the man who is bringing in the bomb. And back in the USSR, Petrofsky's boss is so disgruntled that Petrofsky and so much of his department's resources are being taken by the Chairman for his op, that he calls his old friend, the Vice-Chairman of the KGB, to find out what's going on because he believes that the Chairman wouldn't be able to do any of these things without his friend's input.
