Major Dellaplane tirelessly matches the dead and the wounded with families' descriptions. Honor and ethics drive him; he hates the idea of \"the unknown soldier.\" Into his sector, looking for her husband, comes a haughty, politically connected Parisian, Madame Ir\u00e8ne de Courtil. Brusquely, Dellaplane offers her 1/350,000th of his time, but as their paths cross and she sees his courage and resolve, feelings change. After he finds a surprising connection between her missing husband and a local teacher, Ir\u00e8ne makes Dellaplane an offer. This man of action hesitates: has he missed his only chance?", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 98596, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 1098}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:25:48.537000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Intense character study of men and women driven by an overpowering obsession with the past.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRkNWIwNjAtYTBiZC00ZmVlLWFmY2EtYjYyZGVjOTY4YTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 621043200000, "runtime": 135, "title": "Life and Nothing But", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1096934400000, "lastUpdated": 1441995147000, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 396, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jean Cosmos (scenario & adaptation)", "Bertrand Tavernier (scenario & adaptation)", "Jean Cosmos (dialogue)"], "year": 1989}
