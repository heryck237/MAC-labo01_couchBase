Alan is a musician, just down to New York from Boston, hanging out with his friend Lawrence and Lawrence's girlfriend Ellie. Alan and Ellie are on a bed talking: is this prelude or possibility? Sara, who has interviewed Alan for the radio, seems attracted to Alan, but Alan may not be so sure. They, too, sit on the edge of a bed. He has a gig; it goes well. How should he handle Sara? Has the moment with Ellie passed? Do things play out or does time merely pass as bodies move through space?", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 446747, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 1522}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-23 00:29:30.057000000", "metacritic": 84, "plot": "Alan is a musician who leaves a busted-up band for New York, and a new musical voyage.
