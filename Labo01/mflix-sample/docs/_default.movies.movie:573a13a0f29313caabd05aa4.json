Three young rap artists are looking for a break. They need money to buy some music equipment so they can go to Las Vegas and enter a contest. They meet up with a local pimp named Mack Daddy who agrees to \"hook them up\", but later declines. The rappers want to get even with him so one night they break into Mack's place and steal a lot of his jewelry, gold, and even the medallion from an ugly looking statue. Shouldn't have done that! Because without the medallion, the statue transforms into the Leprechaun, who goes on a killing spree looking for his missing gold, once again! And the song says it all, \"there's nothing' scarier than a Lep' in the hood!\"", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 209095, "rating": 3.6, "votes": 4139}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:31:38.410000000", "plot": "When three rappers want to get even with a pimp, they accidentally unleash a leprechaun who goes on a killing rampage in the 'hood.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGNkMzc4MDEtNTcxYi00YTk5LTkyOWQtZTA3ZGVmYWM3ZDliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 954201600000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Leprechaun in the Hood", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 6, "rating": 3.4}, "dvd": 954201600000, "fresh": 2, "lastUpdated": 1440443113000, "production": "Trimark", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 10202, "rating": 2.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Jones (characters)", "William Wells (story)", "Alan Reynolds (story)", "Rob Spera (story)", "Doug Hall (story)", "Doug Hall (screenplay)", "Jon Huffman (screenplay)"], "year": 2000}
