Schubert and Schumann are her forte, but she's not quite at concert level. She's approaching middle age, living with her mother who is domineering then submissive; Erika is a victim then combative. With her students she is severe. She visits a sex shop to watch DVDs; she walks a drive-in theater to stare at couples having sex. Walter is a self-assured student with some musical talent; he auditions for her class and is forthright in his attraction to her. She responds coldly then demands he let her lead. Next she changes the game with a letter, inviting him into her fantasies. How will he respond; how does sex have power over our other faculties?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 254686, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 34706}, "languages": ["French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 01:03:28.513000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young man romantically pursues his masochistic piano teacher.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBkYjYxYjUtMTdmMS00MDJhLWEyNzktYzg2OWY5NWY0Y2QyL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 999648000000, "runtime": 131, "title": "The Piano Teacher", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.7M", "consensus": "Though it makes for rather unpleasant viewing, The Piano Teacher is a riveting and powerful psychosexual drama.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 81, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1168300800000, "fresh": 59, "lastUpdated": 1441912444000, "production": "MK2 Diffusion", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 19675, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.kino.com/pianoteacher/index.htm"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Michael Haneke", "Elfriede Jelinek (novel)"], "year": 2001}
