Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe have been engaged for some time, but life seems to always get in the way of them actually getting married. They eventually want to resettle back in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, despite Green Gables' dilapidated condition and the fact that they do not own it. But their latest detour takes them to New York City as Gilbert's tenure at Bellevue Hospital has been extended. Anne, who has resisted moving to New York City in the past with him, decides to go this time. While pursuing her writing career, she gets a job as a junior editor at Winfield Publishing, where she meets the company's star writer, Jack Garrison, who aspires to write more serious works than the pulp fiction he is required to churn out for Winfield. But not only affecting Anne and Gilbert's life but that of everyone they know, World War I takes hold and further complicates matters. Their respective war efforts separate the couple. As Anne tries to reconnect with Gilbert, she meets up with some familiar faces, including Jack, who is keeping a secret about his family and his role in the war.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 158466, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2789}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:59:07.650000000", "plot": "The continuing adventures of Anne Shirley in New York and in France during World War I.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzMxOTU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5ODA4Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 964310400000, "runtime": 185, "title": "Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1119916800000, "lastUpdated": 1438021106000, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 8986, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeff Boulton (interactive adaptation)", "Lucy Maud Montgomery (characters)", "Laurie Pearson", "Kevin Sullivan"], "year": 2000}
