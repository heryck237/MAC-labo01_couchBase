Saved by the pharaoh's daughter Bithiah, he is adopted by her and brought up in the court of her brother, Pharaoh Seti. Moses gains Seti's favor and the love of the throne princess Nefertiri, as well as the hatred of Seti's son, Rameses. When his Hebrew heritage is revealed, Moses is cast out of Egypt, and makes his way across the desert where he marries, has a son and is commanded by God to return to Egypt to free the Hebrews from slavery. In Egypt, Moses' fiercest enemy proves to be not Rameses, but someone near to him who can 'harden his heart'.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 49833, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 44245}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 01:06:46.180000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The Egyptian Prince, Moses, learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxYjUxZDgtYTQ5Zi00YmQ1LWJmZmItODZkOTYyNDhiNWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -417830400000, "runtime": 220, "title": "The Ten Commandments", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Bombastic and occasionally silly but extravagantly entertaining, Cecil B.
