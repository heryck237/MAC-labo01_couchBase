It's a big story, and the intense, plain-spoken Maris is the bad guy: sports writers bait him and minimize his talent, fans cheer Mantle, the league's golden boy, and baseball's commissioner announces that Ruth's record stands unless it's broken within 154 games. Any record set after 154 games of the new 162-game schedule will have an asterisk. The film follows the boys of summer, on and off the field: their friendship, the stresses on Maris, his frustration with the negative attention, and his desire to play well, win, and go home.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 250934, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 11192}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:15:53.043000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle race to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDcxMjE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAwNTYxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-MA", "released": 988416000000, "runtime": 129, "title": "61*", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 15, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1000166400000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1442082511000, "production": "Face Productions", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 15648, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hank Steinberg"], "year": 2001}
