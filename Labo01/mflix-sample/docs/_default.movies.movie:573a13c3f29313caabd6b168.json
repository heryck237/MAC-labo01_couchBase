Two octopi entwine in an embrace when a hand reaches from above, plucks them out of the water, disentangles them, tosses the male back in what now we see is a small aquarium, puts the female in a cold storage box, and heads for a delivery truck. He recovers from the initial shock and gives pursuit, grabbing the back of the truck as it leaves, then working himself to the front. As the driver tries to thwart his efforts to save his woman, the truck careens through the small coastal town. Will he succeed? Do other perils await?", "genres": ["Animation", "Short", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1323941, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2286}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:47:10.750000000", "plot": "Two Octopi fight for their lives with a stubborn restaurant cook in a comical escape through the streets of a small Greek village.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBmNmNjOTQtZWJlYS00MmM2LWIwMDQtMjk0Mzk1ZjcxNjAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1238544000000, "runtime": 3, "title": "Oktapodi", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1432407778000, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 284, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2007}
