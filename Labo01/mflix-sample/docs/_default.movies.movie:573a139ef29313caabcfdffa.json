Now children evacuated from London are overwhelming volunteers to house them. Practically under protest, Mr. Tom takes in a painfully quiet 10-year-old, who gradually reveals big problems. William nightly wets the bed. He can't read or write, although he is intelligent and shows artistic talent. He constantly dreads going to hell. Scars cover his back. Mr. Tom soon realizes that his little boarder comes from a horribly abusive home, and determines to provide him a better one. All goes well until William's mother persuades him to return to London for a few days' visit. When Mr. Tom hears nothing from the boy after two weeks, he can endure the loneliness and worry no longer.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 175680, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 2461}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 02:53:18.957000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A shy and quiet WWII evacuee is housed by a disgruntled old man, but they soon develop a close friendship.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNDY5MTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzgyNDgwMzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 928022400000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Goodnight, Mister Tom", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1132617600000, "lastUpdated": 1442341813000, "production": "Public Broadcasting Service", "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 2072, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Brian Finch (adaptation)", "Michelle Magorian (novel)"], "year": 1998}
