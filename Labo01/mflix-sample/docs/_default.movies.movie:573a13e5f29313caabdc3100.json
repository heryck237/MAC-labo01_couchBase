Drifting through Europe after fleeing political violence in India that killed the family restaurant business and their mother, the Kadams arrive in France. Once there, a chance auto accident and the kindness of a young woman, Marguerite, in the village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val inspires Papa Kadam to set up a Indian restaurant there. Unfortunately, this puts the Kadams in direct competition with the snobbish Madame Mallory's acclaimed haute cuisine establishment across the street where Marguerite also works as a sous-chef. The resulting rivalry eventually escalates in personal intensity until it goes too far. In response, there is a bridging of sides initiated by Hassan, Marguerite and Madame Mallory herself, both professional and personal, that encourages an understanding that will change both sides forever.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2980648, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 40867}, "languages": ["English", "French", "Hindi"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:57:34.283000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "The Kadam family leaves India for France where they open a restaurant directly across the road from Madame Mallory's Michelin-starred eatery.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mjg2MTE4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcyNDMwMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1407456000000, "runtime": 122, "title": "The Hundred-Foot Journey", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Director Lasse Hallstr\u00e8m does lovely work and Helen Mirren is always worth watching, but The Hundred-Foot Journey travels predictable ground already covered by countless feel-good dramedies.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 127, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1417478400000, "fresh": 86, "lastUpdated": 1441997387000, "production": "Walt Disney Pictures", "rotten": 41, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 31633, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://100footjourneymovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steven Knight (screenplay)", "Richard C.
