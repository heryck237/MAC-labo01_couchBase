Trains rumble by down below. Lights come on in the buildings as night falls. There is a man behind the camera, looking for an image -- of himself? Of the world? Of society? By day and night, in rain and snow, he stands filming at the window of his studio. Periodically we hear people leaving messages on his answering machine. They talk about the weather while on vacation and congratulate him on his birthday. His father dies, a child is born, the young family begins to fall apart. Time passes. Slowly the cityscape morphs into the inner landscape of the man behind the camera.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1556690, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 48}, "languages": ["Swiss German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-08 00:21:09.193000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A smokestack stubbornly pierces the sky.
