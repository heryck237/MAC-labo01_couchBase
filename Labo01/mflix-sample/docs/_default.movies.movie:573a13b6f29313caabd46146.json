Even the simple act of buttering and eating a roll takes on the appearance of an assembly line. When Fiona, who manages a fast-food restaurant, accidentally locks herself in the restaurant's walk-in freezer overnight, her family doesn't even miss her. She realizes how pointless her life has become and runs away; to seek happiness, put her life right again and perhaps to visit the icebergs with which she begins an obsession. On a bus trip to nowhere, she becomes friendly with an older lady, Fernande, who offers Fiona a place to stay and diversion in her seaside community. There, Fiona becomes attracted to Ren\u00e8, who owns a small sailboat, and has been a deaf-mute since a fire in which his parents died. In time, the pair embark on a sailing voyage, unknowingly pursued by the persistent Julien, who has managed to track Fiona down. When the men squabble and fall overboard, Fiona sets sail for the polar regions with a vengeance, ultimately tearing the bottom out of the boat on - you guessed it - an iceberg! Miraculously, the three castaways are all fished out of the ocean by Lucy, an Inuit girl who operates a commercial fishing boat. The final resolution of the love triangle caps the farcical nature of this unusual film.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 484113, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 719}, "languages": ["French", "Inuktitut"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-08 00:31:53.287000000", "metacritic": 60, "plot": "Fiona, Julien and their two clone-like children live a life appropriate to the robots they have become, in a style-less, cheerless suburb somewhere in the flatlands of French-speaking ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAyNTE2NDE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYyOTI1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1133913600000, "runtime": 84, "title": "L'iceberg", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Relying more on inventive slapstick than dialogue for its humor, L'iceberg is an irreverent and charming comedy.", "critic": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 32, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1190073600000, "fresh": 22, "lastUpdated": 1442337812000, "production": "First Run Features", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 876, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.firstrunfeatures.com/iceberg_synopsis.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dominique Abel", "Fiona Gordon", "Bruno Romy"], "year": 2005}
