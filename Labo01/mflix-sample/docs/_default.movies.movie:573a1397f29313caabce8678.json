Why would he commit an act that apparently negates the principles he has striven for so long to uphold? Eventually, he reveals a secret about himself that he kept hidden from his younger wife Lina, and that in a roundabout way concerns her as well. It is the conclusion of a struggle that started many decades earlier, when Elsa Wiener, a German singer exiled in Paris, without money or relations, a refugee among many others, faced two daunting problems: surviving in a foreign city, and saving her husband Michel from the clutches of the Nazis.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 84479, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 630}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:29:27.710000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Max Baumstein is a reputable businessman, a rich self-made man with a conscience - he founded a highly visible and active international organization fighting against violations of human ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNDUxMTQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTgwNDI5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 387590400000, "runtime": 110, "title": "La passante du Sans-Souci", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439577789000, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 18, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jacques Rouffio (scenario and adaptation)", "Jacques Kirsner (scenario and adaptation)", "Joseph Kessel (novel)"], "year": 1982}
