In 1937, the invading Japanese army murdered over 200,000 and raped tens of thousands of Chinese. In the midst of the horror, a small group of Western expatriates banded together to save 250,000 -- an act of extraordinary heroism. Bringing an event little-known outside of Asia to a global audience, \"Nanking\" shows the tremendous impact individuals can make on the course of history. It is a gripping account of light in the darkest of times.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 893356, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 2747}, "languages": ["Japanese", "Mandarin", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:04:22.233000000", "metacritic": 76, "plot": "Through readings of historical account by actors and the testimony of survivors, the events of the Nanjing Massacre are recounted.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MTAwMjI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzMjc1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1183420800000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Nanking", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$45.5k", "consensus": "This powerful and horrific documentary brings the atrocities committed at Nanking to light without sugarcoating any of the brutality.", "critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 47, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1209427200000, "fresh": 45, "lastUpdated": 1441996145000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 5132, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://nankingthefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Guttentag (screenplay)", "Dan Sturman (screenplay)", "Elizabeth Bentley (screenplay)", "Bill Guttentag (story)", "Dan Sturman (story)"], "year": 2007}
