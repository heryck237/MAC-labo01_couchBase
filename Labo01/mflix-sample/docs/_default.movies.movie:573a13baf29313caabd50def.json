When he looked into the little girl's eyes, which are also lacking in emotion, something seemed to overlap his wounded heart. \"Have you ever seen a blue sky? Where clouds appear like cotton candy and a white bird is flying high?\" \"Would you like to walk with me?\" Yasuda and Sachi begin their long walk....
