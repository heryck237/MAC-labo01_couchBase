Floyd, who's bored in retirement, wants this more than anything; Louis, a philosophical ex-con, does not. Plus, there's bad blood between them (Louis's wife Odetta left him to marry Floyd - then left Floyd). Floyd begs, Louis consents but won't fly, so they leave L.A. in Floyd's flashy Cadillac with five days to get to New York. On the road, they must get back their vocal chops, renew their friendship, and sort out the past. With Floyd's bad hip and Louis's bad kidneys, will they even make it?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 1111948, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 7361}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:42:47.407000000", "metacritic": 49, "plot": "Though it's been some twenty years since they have spoken with one another, two estranged soul-singing legends agree to participate in a reunion performance at the Apollo Theater to honor their recently deceased band leader.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNjM4NDM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTM5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1226016000000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Soul Men", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$12.0M", "consensus": "Soul Men features lively performances from Bernie Mac and Samuel L.
