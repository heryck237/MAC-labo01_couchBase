This documentary follows the assault on the record by Steve Wiebe, an earnest teacher from Washington who took up the game while unemployed. The top scores are monitored by a cadre of players and fans associated with Walter Day, an Iowan who runs Funspot, an annual tournament. Wiebe breaks Mitchell's record in public at Funspot, and Mitchell promptly mails a controversial video tape of himself setting a new record. So Wiebe travels to Florida hoping Mitchell will face him for the 2007 Guinness World Records. Will the mind-game-playing Mitchell engage; who will end up holding the record?", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 923752, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 29008}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:28:22.923000000", "metacritic": 83, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Die-hard gamers compete to break world records on classic arcade games.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMmIwNzEtODhhOS00ZjFjLWI1OGMtNjBiMDFkMTgzZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1204156800000, "runtime": 79, "title": "The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.5M", "consensus": "The King of Kong is funny and compelling with more than a few poignant insights into human behavior.
