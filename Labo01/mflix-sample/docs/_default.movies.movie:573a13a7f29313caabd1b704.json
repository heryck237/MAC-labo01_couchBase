In 1991, they were forced to flee to Kenya; 12,000 survived to live in a U.N. camp in Kakuma. Archival footage documents the 1,000 mile flight; we see life in the camp. We follow three young men who repatriate to the U.S. John Bul Dau goes to Syracuse, and by the film's end, becomes a spokesperson for the Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan; Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Bior go to Pittsburgh. All work several jobs, send money back to the camp, search for relatives lost in the civil war, acclimatize to the U.S., seek an education, and miss their homeland.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 301555, "rating": 8, "votes": 2377}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:31:54.520000000", "metacritic": 72, "plot": "Four boys from Sudan embark on a journey to America after years of wandering Sub-Saharan Africa in search of safety.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk2OTIwMzUzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU3MzU0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1168560000000, "runtime": 89, "title": "God Grew Tired of Us", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.1M", "consensus": "Not just a powerful telling of the journey of exiled Sudanese boys, God Grew Tired of Us is also a poignant account of the determination of the human spirit.", "critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 70, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1187049600000, "fresh": 64, "lastUpdated": 1440357003000, "production": "Newmarket Films", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 5941, "rating": 4.3}, "website": "http://www.godgrewtiredofus.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Christopher Dillon Quinn"], "year": 2006}
