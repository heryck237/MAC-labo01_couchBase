A few months ago, he solved a gruesome case of serial murders, although an undercover police officer lost her life. A new set of similar murders begins: the bodies are elaborately displayed and the killer uses equipment from art and early movie making in the tableau, or he leaves a clue as to where the investigators are to stand to get the full artistic effect. Stan is paired with a younger detective, Carl, whom he brushes off when Carl wants to get to know him. As pieces fall in place, it's a race to prevent the next killing, quite possibly someone close to Stan.", "genres": ["Crime", "Horror", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 497323, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 7897}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:11:22.680000000", "metacritic": 43, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A psychological thriller based on the concept of anamorphosis, a painting technique that manipulates the laws of perspective to create two competing images on a single canvas.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDg3MTI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk0MzQ2MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1217894400000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Anamorph", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Thin on plot but heavy on academic references, Anamorph proves more derivative than terrifying.", "critic": {"meter": 27, "numReviews": 26, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 1228780800000, "fresh": 7, "lastUpdated": 1441044023000, "production": "IFC First Take", "rotten": 19, "viewer": {"meter": 24, "numReviews": 3079, "rating": 2.7}, "website": "http://www.ifcfilms.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Henry Miller", "Tom Phelan"], "year": 2007}
