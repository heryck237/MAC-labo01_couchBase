A devout couple, Moshe and Mali, married nearly five years and childless, are broke and praying for a miracle. Suddenly, miracles abound: a friend finds Moshe a sukkah he says is abandoned, Moshe is the beneficiary of local charitable fundraising, and two escaped convicts arrive on Moshe and Mali's doorstep in time to be their ushpizin - their guests. The miracles then become trials. Rabbinical advice, absolution, an effort to avoid anger, and a 1000-shekel citron figure in Moshe's dark night of the soul.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 426155, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 1622}, "languages": ["Hebrew", "Yiddish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:36:10.660000000", "metacritic": 70, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "An Orthodox Jewish couple's faith is tested after praying to the Lord for a child on the Succoth holiday.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNiN2JjMjEtOTkxZS00YzU2LThiZGUtNzVhMTlkYTBkOTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMyMzI4MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1132876800000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Ushpizin", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.4M", "consensus": "Ushpizin offers a rare and warmly intimate look into ultra-Orthodox Jewish culture.", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 61, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1144108800000, "fresh": 57, "lastUpdated": 1442337388000, "production": "Picturehouse", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 3444, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.ushpizin.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Shuli Rand"], "year": 2004}
