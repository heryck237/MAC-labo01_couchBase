It's the last day before everyone goes back to the real world, but there's still a summer's worth of unfinished business to resolve.

He is busy trying to save the camp from a deadly piece of NASA's Skylab which is hurtling toward earth. All that, plus: a dangerous waterfall rescue, love triangles, misfits, cool kids, and talking vegetable cans. The questions will all be resolved, of course, at the big talent show at the end of the day.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 243655, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 34860}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:28:56.540000000", "metacritic": 42, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Set on the last day of camp, in the hot summer of 1981, a group of counselors try to complete their unfinished business before the day ends.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdjYjlhNTctNDY0Yi00ZTM4LWE1MWItYWUzNmYwYWU0OTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1018483200000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Wet Hot American Summer", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "As comedy, Wet Hot American Summer is a slapdash, fragmented affair that misses more often than hits.
