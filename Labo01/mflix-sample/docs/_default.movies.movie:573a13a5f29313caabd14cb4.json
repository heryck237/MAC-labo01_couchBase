He's late, she's gone on to Niagara Falls, so he has two days, traveling slowly and reluctantly, to get to the wedding. At the airport, he meets Alicia, a lively Latin, going with her boyfriend to see her family. George is smitten. Partly by happenstance, and partly by the designs of Gerard, a romantic and manic Frenchman George meets at the airport, his path crosses Alicia's a few times. As Gerard puts it, George should seize the chance to see what happens with Alicia - he can always jump tomorrow. Can George take on fate and custom?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 273300, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1249}, "languages": ["English", "French", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-29 00:27:37.520000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A young Nigerian man on the verge of being in an arranged marriage, suddenly questions his situation after an encounter with a stunning Latin woman, who is also about to be married.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNzk1MDEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg5OTYyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1005264000000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Jump Tomorrow", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The light-hearted romantic comedy Jump Tomorrow charms with its whimsy and sweetness.", "critic": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 54, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1063670400000, "fresh": 44, "lastUpdated": 1439402575000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 817, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.jump-tomorrow.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joel Hopkins (screenplay)", "Joel Hopkins (short story \"Jorge\")", "Iain Tibbles (additional writer)"], "year": 2001}
