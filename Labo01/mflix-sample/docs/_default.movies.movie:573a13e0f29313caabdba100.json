But when George loses his job soon after, the couple must sell their apartment and - victims of the relentless New York City real estate market - temporarily live apart until they can find an affordable new home. While George moves in with two cops (Cheyenne Jackson and Manny Perez) who live down stairs, Ben lands in Brooklyn with his nephew (Darren Burrows), his wife (Marisa Tomei), and their temperamental teenage son (Charlie Tahan), with whom Ben shares a bunk bed. While struggling with the pain of separation, Ben and George are further challenged by the intergenerational tensions and capricious family dynamics of their new living arrangements.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2639344, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 7548}, "languages": ["English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:08:56.030000000", "metacritic": 82, "plot": "After Ben and George get married, George is fired from his teaching post, forcing them to stay with friends separately while they sell their place and look for cheaper housing -- a situation that weighs heavily on all involved.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MTkxOTI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzAwNDA4MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1415750400000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Love Is Strange", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$2.3M", "consensus": "Held aloft by remarkable performances from John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, Love Is Strange serves as a graceful tribute to the beauty of commitment in the face of adversity.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 154, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1421107200000, "fresh": 145, "lastUpdated": 1439921371000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 12521, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://loveisstrangemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ira Sachs", "Mauricio Zacharias"], "year": 2014}
