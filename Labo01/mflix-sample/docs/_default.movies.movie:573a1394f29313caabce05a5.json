When the photo session is over the store is left in a shambles, much to salesgirl Jo Stockton's dismay. Avery stays behind to help her clean up. Later, he examines the photos taken there and sees Jo in the background of one shot. He is intrigued by her unique appearance, as is Maggie Prescott, the editor of a leading fashion magazine. They offer Jo a modeling contract, which she reluctantly accepts only because it includes a trip to Paris. Eventually, her snobbish attitude toward the job softens, and Jo begins to enjoy the work and the company of her handsome photographer.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Musical", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 50419, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 17074}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:13:52.703000000", "plot": "An impromptu fashion shoot at a book store brings about a new fashion model discovery in the shop clerk.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkZmY2MGUtNjdlMy00ODVmLTliZjEtNTFjZGRhNTY0MWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": -406512000000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Funny Face", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 31, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 986860800000, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1440354178000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 40511, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Leonard Gershe"], "year": 1957}
