He and several of his colleagues, who once made a living in American Westerns shot in Spain, now are reduced to doing stunt shows for minuscule audiences on the decaying set built for those old Westerns. Juli\u00e8n wrestles with dark memories of the death of his son, also a stuntman, and with estrangement from his daughter-in-law Laura and her son Carlos. Carlos, a young boy, becomes intrigued with his late father's life and runs away to join Juli\u00e8n and his band of has-beens. There Carlos is initiated into the rambunctious life of these hard-drinking faux cowboys. But when Laura, a powerful executive looking for a new site for a tourist resort, learns that Carlos has joined the hated Juli\u00e8n, she moves to destroy even this remnant of Juli\u00e8n's once-proud career. Juli\u00e8n and the cowboys decide to fight back the only way they know how.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 292886, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 3203}, "languages": ["Spanish", "English", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:32:19.290000000", "metacritic": 51, "plot": "Juli\u00e8n Torralba is a former movie stuntman in Almeria, Spain.
