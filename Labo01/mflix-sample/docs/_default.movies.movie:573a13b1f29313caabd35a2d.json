Papist Spain wants to bring down the heretic Elizabeth. Philip is building an armada but needs a rationale to attack. With covert intrigue, Spain sets a trap for the Queen and her principal secretary, Walsingham, using as a pawn Elizabeth's cousin Mary Stuart, who's under house arrest in the North. The trap springs, and the armada sets sail, to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack. During these months, the Virgin Queen falls in love with Walter Raleigh, keeping him close to court and away from the sea and America. Is treachery or heroism at his heart? Does loneliness await her passionate majesty?", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 414055, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 51302}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "Swedish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:02:27.007000000", "metacritic": 45, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A mature Queen Elizabeth endures multiple crises late in her reign including court intrigues, an assassination plot, the Spanish Armada, and romantic disappointments.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzODIwNzcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0MTQ1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1192147200000, "runtime": 114, "title": "Elizabeth: The Golden Age", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$16.3M", "consensus": "This sequel is full of lavish costumes and elaborate sets, but lacks the heart and creativity of the original Elizabeth", "critic": {"meter": 35, "numReviews": 165, "rating": 5.1}, "dvd": 1202169600000, "fresh": 58, "lastUpdated": 1439835455000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 107, "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 367720, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.elizabeththegoldenage.net/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Nicholson", "Michael Hirst"], "year": 2007}
