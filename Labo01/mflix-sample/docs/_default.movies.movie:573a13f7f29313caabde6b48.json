They moved to Moscow many years ago and have become successful. Olga is an actress, Katya works for a large-scale PR agency, and Andrey is a political analyst. They buy cars, take mortgages, build country houses. Just like everybody else. But their lives bring them neither happiness nor content. The feeling of \"something's not right but I can't put my finger on it\" underpins the lives of today's thirty-year-olds. Their childhood took place during the Soviet era, when kids dreamed of becoming heroes, believed in spy stories and a bright future. Yet nobody expected that the dream of becoming a hero would be replaced by the dream of stable and predictable existence. People have stopped dreaming of truly grand things. They just play their roles.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 4384398, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 61}, "languages": ["Russian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:50:10.240000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "1987.
