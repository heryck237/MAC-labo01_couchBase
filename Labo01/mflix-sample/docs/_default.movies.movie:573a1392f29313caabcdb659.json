With tableaux beautifully vivid and forceful, it recounts the touching relationships which develop when Gorky is put into custody at his grandparents' home. His grandmother, a simple woman who knows how to make people laugh, represents optimism in the direst situations, honesty in a world of deceit. Gorky's poverty-stricken childhood formed his life-long compassion for the underdog, and the film is filled with powerful portraits of lower class people whose qualities of integrity and dignity shine through their hopeless circumstances. Among many others are the half-blind Grigory, who works at the grandfather's dye factory, and Gorky's little orphaned friends, who live out of garbage cans, dreaming of a utopian neverland. From these portraits come an inspiring, panoramic view of human conditions and conflicts.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 30055, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 390}, "languages": ["Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-17 18:38:09.420000000", "plot": "A drama reveals the great writer's inauspicious early years as an orphan raised by conniving relatives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODk2MTk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM4OTcxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -986601600000, "runtime": 98, "title": "The Childhood of Maxim Gorky", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1027382400000, "lastUpdated": 1441135744000, "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 56, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Donskoy", "Maxim Gorky (books)", "Ilya Gruzdev"], "year": 1938}
