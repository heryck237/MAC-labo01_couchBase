Both sisters are haunted by their long-standing childhood competition for the affections of their cruel, emotionally distant father. However, when Lucie's modeling connections lead to an exclusive recording contract offer despite the fact that she cannot sing, Lucie is forced to seek out Marie, who possesses a good singing voice, to perform in her place. Marie reluctantly agrees, but when she returns from the performance she finds that Lucie has committed suicide, leaving her no choice but to assume Lucie's name.
