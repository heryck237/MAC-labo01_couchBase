Crime is rife, especially drugs and drug violence. A Russian thug is building his heroin trade, while everyone laughs at the cops. Brothers have chosen different paths: Joe has followed his father Bert into New York's Finest; he's a rising star. Bobby, who uses his mother's maiden name, manages a club. Bobby too is on the rise: he has a new girlfriend and a green-light to develop a Manhattan club. Joe and Bert ask him to help with intelligence gathering; he declines. Then, Joe raids Bobby's club to arrest the Russian. From there, things spiral out of control: the Russian puts out a hit on Joe, personal losses mount, and Bobby's loyalties face the test.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 498399, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 69992}, "languages": ["English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:23:49.343000000", "metacritic": 59, "plot": "A New York nightclub manager tries to save his brother and father from Russian mafia hit men.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTQ5OTcyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE0NzUzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1192147200000, "runtime": 117, "title": "We Own the Night", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$28.6M", "consensus": "Bland characters, clich\u00e8d dialogue and rickety plotting ensure We Own The Night never lives up to its potential.", "critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 146, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1202860800000, "fresh": 83, "lastUpdated": 1442431216000, "production": "Sony/Columbia", "rotten": 63, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 264066, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/weownthenight/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["James Gray"], "year": 2007}
