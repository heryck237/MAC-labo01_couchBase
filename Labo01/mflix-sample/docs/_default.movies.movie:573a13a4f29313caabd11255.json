This is a film version of the play they wrote based on more than 200 interviews they conducted in Laramie. It follows and in some cases re-enacts the chronology of Shepard's visit to a local bar, his kidnap and beating, the discovery of him tied to a fence, the vigil at the hospital, his death and funeral, and the trial of his killers. It mixes real news reports with actors portraying friends, family, cops, killers, and other Laramie residents in their own words. It concludes with a Laramie staging of \"Angels in America\" a year after Shephard's death.", "genres": ["Drama", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 257850, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 5384}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:01:02.313000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The true story of an American town in the wake of the murder of Matthew Shepard.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzczNDAzNzU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgyNjgxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-14", "released": 1015632000000, "runtime": 97, "title": "The Laramie Project", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1024963200000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1440615811000, "production": "HBO Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 7133, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mois\u00e8s Kaufman (play)", "Mois\u00e8s Kaufman (screenplay)", "Stephen Belber (play)", "Stephen Belber (screenplay)", "Amanda Gronich (play)", "Amanda Gronich (screenplay)", "Greg Pierotti (play)", "Greg Pierotti (screenplay)", "Kelli Simpkins (play)", "Kelli Simpkins (screenplay)", "Jeffrey LaHoste (play)", "Jeffrey LaHoste (screenplay)", "John McAdams (play)", "John McAdams (screenplay)", "Leigh Fondakowski (play)", "Leigh Fondakowski (screenplay)", "Andy Paris (play)", "Andy Paris (screenplay)", "Barbara Pitts (play)", "Barbara Pitts (screenplay)", "Stephen Wangh (play)", "Stephen Wangh (screenplay)"], "year": 2002}
