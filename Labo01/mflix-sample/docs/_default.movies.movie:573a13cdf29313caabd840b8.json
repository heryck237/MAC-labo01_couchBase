The madam essentially owns the women: their expenses exceed earnings, they are in debt. They face problems of pregnancy, opium, age, and violent clients. One reads sociology at her peril. Occasionally, a client talks of marriage. There are also friendships and affection among the women. The madam is in a dispute with her landlord and calls on influential clients to help.

In a coda, we watch a street scene in contemporary Paris.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1660379, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 4088}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:48:25.103000000", "metacritic": 75, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "Life in an elegant Parisian brothel in the early twentieth century.
