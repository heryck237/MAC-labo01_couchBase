While he comes across as crass nouveau riche, she appears more liberal. Their conspicuous affluence, however, makes them ideal targets for kidnappers, and the trio of Trece, Budu and Niga gets a bead on them and promptly sweeps them up at gunpoint. The kidnappers then demand $20,000 to be delivered in two hours. Carla phones her rich father Sergio to procure the money, but chaos soon ensues. A botched ATM robbery is followed by a stopover at the palatial estate of a gay drug dealer.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 371939, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 2176}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:16:40.007000000", "metacritic": 48, "plot": "Young couple Carla (Maestro) and Martin (Leroux) are abducted by three men and spend a terrifying night in Caracas as they wait for Carla's father (Blades) to hand over the ransom.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDc3NzUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMzMTAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1141948800000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Secuestro express", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jonathan Jakubowicz"], "year": 2005}
