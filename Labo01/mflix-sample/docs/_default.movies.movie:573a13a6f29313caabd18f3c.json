Amid the backbreaking work and stifling ignorance of the community, the two boys find that music, and the presence of the beautiful local young women are the only pleasant things in their miserable life. However, none compare to the young seamstress granddaughter of the local tailor. Stealing a departing student's secret cache of forbidden books of classic western literature such as the works of Honore de Balzac, they set about to woo her and teach her things she had never imagined. In doing so, they start a journey that would profoundly change her perspective on her world and teach the boys about the power of literature and their own ability to change their world in truly revolutionary ways.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 291032, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3678}, "languages": ["Mandarin", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 01:03:45.547000000", "metacritic": 65, "plot": "Two youths sent for a Maoist \"re-education\" in the mountains fall in love with the village tailor's granddaughter.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NDc5OTk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA1MzEzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1034121600000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.3M", "consensus": "This delicately told fable about the power of literature is a lyrical delight.", "critic": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 62, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1135641600000, "fresh": 48, "lastUpdated": 1442268647000, "production": "Soda Pictures Ltd.", "rotten": 14, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 4616, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.empirepicturesusa.com/ep/show_movie.asp?title=10029&subselect=1"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sijie Dai (novel)", "Sijie Dai (screenplay)", "Nadine Perront"], "year": 2002}
