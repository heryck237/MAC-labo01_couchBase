Duncan"], "fullplot": "One of our favourite natural history subjects, the good old dinosaur, gets a makeover and then some in this fantastically ambitious and groundbreaking documentary. Based on cutting-edge palaeontology and the latest fossil records, DINOTASIA presents a series of vignettes about dinosaurs - both familiar faces and some we have only found out about in the past ten years. The film uses CGI to bring the stories to life, but draws on animation's birth in silent film and early Disney to create proper, traditional visual storytelling. Werner Herzog narrates, reuniting with the team behind GRIZZLY MAN and CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Animation"], "imdb": {"id": 2387443, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 210}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:37:10.623000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A collection of vignettes presenting possible experiences in the lives of dinosaurs during various periods.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNTQ4MTU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0NzA2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1359072000000, "runtime": 83, "title": "Dinotasia", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 25, "numReviews": 8, "rating": 4.1}, "dvd": 1352160000000, "fresh": 2, "lastUpdated": 1441223351000, "production": "Revolver Entertainment", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 45, "numReviews": 887, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/film/Dinotasia/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Krentz", "Erik Nelson"], "year": 2012}
