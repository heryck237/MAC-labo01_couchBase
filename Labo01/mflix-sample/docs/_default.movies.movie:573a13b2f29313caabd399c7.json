More often than not, these manifestations have been the result of a few like-minded people coming together to create something new and original for no other purposethan a common love of doing it. In the 1990s, a loose-knit group of American artists and creators, many just out of their teens, began their careers in just such a way. Influenced by the popular underground youth subcultures of the day, such as skateboarding, graffiti, street fashion and independent music, artists like Shepard Fairey, Mark Gonzales, Spike Jonze, Margaret Kilgallen, Mike Mills, Barry McGee, Phil Frost, Chris Johanson, Harmony Korine, and Ed Templeton began to create art that reflected the lifestyles they led. Many had no formal training and almost no conception of the inner workings of the art world. They learned their crafts through practice, trial and error, and good old-fashioned innovation. Not since the Beat Generation have we seen a group of creative individuals with such a unified aesthetic sense and varied cultural facets. The world of art has been greatly affected by their accomplishments as have the worlds of fashion, music, literature, film, and, ironically, athletics. Over the years, the group has matured, and many have become more establishment-oriented; but no matter, their independent spirit has remained steadfast. The story of the Beautiful Losers will be a retrospective celebration of this spirit.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 430916, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1023}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:02:06.460000000", "metacritic": 59, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "This documentary follows the lives and careers of a collective group of Do-it-yourself artists and designers who inadvertently affected the art world.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3Mzk5OTI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQyNTE2MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1217635200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Beautiful Losers", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "An insightful if fawning documentary that explores a group of 90s NYC artists.", "critic": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 28, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1251072000000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1440698562000, "production": "Sidetrack Films", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 1184, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.beautifullosers.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Arty Nelson"], "year": 2008}
