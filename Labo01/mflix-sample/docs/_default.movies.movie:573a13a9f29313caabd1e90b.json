In a sudden, devastating strike, the Cylons return and lay waste to the colonies, aided by human-looking Cylon variants and an unwitting fifth columnist. The attack forces Commander William Adama to call into action his museum-piece warship, the Battlestar Galactica, and soon its company of hotshot fighter pilots is blasting away at the invaders. But their best efforts can't prevent the colonies' obliteration. Fleeing the Cylon genocide, the Galactica leads a rag-tag fleet of survivors on a lonely quest to find humanity's fabled 13th colony -- a planet known as Earth.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 314979, "rating": 8.7, "votes": 40437}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:20:25.760000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A re-imagining of the original series in which a \"rag-tag fugitive fleet\" of the last remnants of mankind flees pursuing robots while simultaneously searching for their true home, Earth.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJlYzgzOWUtZmJlZi00ZGM4LTliNzctNWFkNThlMDJhZDQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-14", "released": 1070841600000, "runtime": 183, "title": "Battlestar Galactica", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1104192000000, "lastUpdated": 1441909807000, "production": "R&D Television", "viewer": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 12195, "rating": 4.3}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2003}
