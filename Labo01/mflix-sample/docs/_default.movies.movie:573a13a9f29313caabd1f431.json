In turn, bandit, transvestite, street fighter, brothel cook, convict and father to seven adopted children, dos Santos--better known as Madame Sat\u00e8--was also a notorious gay performer who pushed social boundaries in a volatile time. The story begins in 1932, in Rio de Janeiro's bohemian Lapa district, when Jo\u00e8o Francisco is about to achieve his dream: becoming a stage star. In the sordid yet lively world of Lapa--populated by pimps, prostitutes and other denizens of Rio's underworld--Jo\u00e8o battles the streets and presides over a surrogate family that includes the charming prostitute Laurita, and her baby daughter whom everyone dotes on; the flamboyant hustler Taboo; Jo\u00e8o's teenage lover, Renatinho; and Amador, the owner of the Blue Danube club which is their second home. It is at the Blue Danube that street tough Jo\u00e8o begins to sing, and the mythic drag artiste Madam Sat\u00e8 is born.", "genres": ["Biography", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 317887, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1834}, "languages": ["Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:08:30.303000000", "metacritic": 59, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Loose portrait of Jo\u00e8o Francisco dos Santos, also known as Madame Sat\u00e8, a sometime chef, transvestite, lover, father, hero and convict from Rio de Janeiro.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzU3NTI1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE3MzAwMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1036713600000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Madame Sat\u00e8", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 42, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1073952000000, "fresh": 25, "lastUpdated": 1438715927000, "production": "Wellspring", "rotten": 17, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 1407, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.wellspring.com/movies/movie.html?movie_id=7"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Karim A\u00e8nouz", "Marcelo Gomes", "S\u00e8rgio Machado", "Mauricio Zacharias"], "year": 2002}
