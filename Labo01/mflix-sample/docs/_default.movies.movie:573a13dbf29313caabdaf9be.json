When a mysterious mass text ripples its way across the country, triggering a crippling, apocalyptic cyber attack, their home transitions from sheltered modern oasis to a fortress for the estranged old friends that show up at their door for protection and community. The unexpected reunion--abundant with revelry and remembrances, generously enhanced by organic wine and weed--is quickly undermined by the slights of the past, the spark of lingering flirtations and the threat of a locally grown new world order. Balancing tense confrontations with slivers of levity, director Denis Henry Hennelly pinpoints a future where ideology explodes into action in every area.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2352802, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 4832}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:42:58.527000000", "metacritic": 36, "plot": "When a mysterious terrorist attack causes chaos in the cities, a group of friends take refuge in their countryside cabin.
