A single mother returns from work to find her nine-year-old son gone. She calls the LAPD to initiate a search. Five months later, a boy is found in Illinois who fits the description; he says he's her son. To fanfare and photos, the LAPD reunite mother and son, but she insists he's not her boy. The cops dismiss her as either a liar or hysterical. When she joins a minister in his public criticism of the police, they in turn use government power to silence and intimidate her. Meanwhile, a cop goes to a dilapidated ranch to find a Canadian lad who's without legal status; the youth tells a grisly tale. There's redress for murder; is there redress for abuse of power?", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 824747, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 188148}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:11.237000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A grief-stricken mother takes on the LAPD to her own detriment when it stubbornly tries to pass off an obvious impostor as her missing child, while also refusing to give up hope that she will find him one day.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA1Mzg3NjIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2NTc5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1225411200000, "runtime": 141, "title": "Changeling", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$35.7M", "consensus": "Beautifully shot and well-acted, Changeling is a compelling story that unfortunately gives in to convention too often.", "critic": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 197, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1234828800000, "fresh": 122, "lastUpdated": 1442082629000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 75, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 226121, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.changelingmovie.net"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["J.
