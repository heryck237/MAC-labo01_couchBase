Even when his car stalls in the middle of nowhere, a roadside soothsayer assures him a windfall is on its way. But although Jimmy should be happy when his boss suddenly agrees to financially back his business venture, he starts to become paranoid instead. As his girlfriend Deirdre and his best friend/ business partner Ed watch him slowly come unwound, Jimmy wonders if a past betrayal of his friend, newly paroled Vince, could be catching up to him. And, as the weather turns cold, Jimmy can't help but fear the mysterious seer's other prediction... that they'll be no tomorrow after the first snow.", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 432289, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 6649}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:12:56.007000000", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A psychic's ominous reading sends a man into a tailspin.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA0OTM5MzQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM2NzI0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1174608000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "First Snow", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.1M", "consensus": "In First Snow, an interesting premise gives way to a slow and tedious noir that adds little to the genre.", "critic": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 73, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1196121600000, "fresh": 42, "lastUpdated": 1440181847000, "production": "Yari Film Group", "rotten": 31, "viewer": {"meter": 41, "numReviews": 5673, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://www.firstsnowthemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Fergus", "Hawk Ostby"], "year": 2006}
