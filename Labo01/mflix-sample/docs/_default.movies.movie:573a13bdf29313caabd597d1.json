His daughter is stealing from him to save up for a nose job, his pot-head son, who gets stoned at his own bar-mitzvah, only wants him round to fix the TV aerial and his useless brother Arthur is an unwelcome house guest. But both Arthur and Larry get turfed out into a motel when Larry's wife Judy, who wants a divorce, moves her lover, Sy, into the house and even after Sy's death in a car crash they are still there. With lawyers' bills mounting for his divorce, Arthur's criminal court appearances and a land feud with a neighbour Larry is tempted to take the bribe offered by a student to give him an illegal exam pass mark. And the rabbis he visits for advice only dole out platitudes. Still God moves in mysterious - and not always pleasant - ways, as Larry and his family will find out.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1019452, "rating": 7, "votes": 93495}, "languages": ["English", "Yiddish", "Hebrew"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:04:21.523000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Larry Gopnik, a Midwestern physics teacher, watches his life unravel over multiple sudden incidents.
