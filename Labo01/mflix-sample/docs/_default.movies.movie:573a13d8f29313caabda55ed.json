It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 2177771, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 91115}, "languages": ["English", "German", "Russian", "French", "Flemish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 18:00:30.150000000", "metacritic": 52, "plot": "An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjk4NTM1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg0MjQ3MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1391731200000, "runtime": 118, "title": "The Monuments Men", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$78.0M", "consensus": "Its intentions are noble and its cast is impressive, but neither can compensate for The Monuments Men's stiffly nostalgic tone and curiously slack narrative.", "critic": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 221, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1400544000000, "fresh": 68, "lastUpdated": 1442081128000, "production": "Sony Pictures", "rotten": 153, "viewer": {"meter": 44, "numReviews": 72360, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.monumentsmenmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["George Clooney (screenplay)", "Grant Heslov (screenplay)", "Robert M.
