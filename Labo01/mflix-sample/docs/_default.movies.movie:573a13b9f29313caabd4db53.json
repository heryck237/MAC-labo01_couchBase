Muslims, Jews and Christians of many kinds pass before his jaundiced eye. Maher goes to a Creationist Museum in Kentucky, which shows that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time 5000 years ago. He talks to truckers at a Truckers' Chapel. (Sign outside: \"Jesus love you.\") He goes to a theme park called Holy Land in Florida. He speaks to a rabbi in league with Holocaust deniers. He talks to a Muslim musician who preaches hatred of Jews. Maher finds the unlikeliest of believers and, in a certain Vatican priest, he even finds an unlikely skeptic.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 815241, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 49814}, "languages": ["English", "Hebrew", "Arabic", "Persian", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:28:38.647000000", "metacritic": 56, "plot": "Bill Maher's take on the current state of world religion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMDcxMTA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk5NzU2MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1222992000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Religulous", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$13.0M", "consensus": "Religulous is funny and offensive in equal measure, and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation.", "critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 152, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1234828800000, "fresh": 106, "lastUpdated": 1440353326000, "production": "Lionsgate Films", "rotten": 46, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 38943, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://disbeliefnet.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2008}
