She lives a self-imposed sheltered life; she is shy and unfulfilled. Things change for her when she is caught in a snowstorm while chasing after her dog, Toto. They are transported to the mysterious Land of Oz, where she is informed that the only possible way to find her way back home is through the assistance of the powerful wizard in the Emerald City. As she goes searching for him, she befriends some creatures who are facing problems in life just like her. In their quest to find and get help from the wizard, they also face Evillene, the equally evil sister of Evermean, the wicked witch whom Dorothy inadvertently killed when she arrived in Oz, and who may be their biggest obstacle in achieving their goals.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 78504, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 10000}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:30:01.157000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "An adaption of \"The Wizard of Oz\" that tries to capture the essence of the African American experience.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0YzkzYjItOThjNi00NTU4LWIxZDEtN2U4NmFkMGFiOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 278035200000, "runtime": 134, "title": "The Wiz", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 30, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 923961600000, "fresh": 6, "lastUpdated": 1440527557000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 14, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 35162, "rating": 3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["L.
