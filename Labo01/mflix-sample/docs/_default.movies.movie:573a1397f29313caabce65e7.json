The only consistent pattern to the crimes involves the perpetrators calm admissions of guilt, explaining, \"God told me to.\" While investigating the murders, catholic police detective Peter Nicholas is increasingly troubled by evidence of a Christ-like figure named Bernard Phillips who appeared to each of the killers and can't seem to shake the feeling that his own fate is somewhat linked to this mysterious being. As he comes closer to the truth, his worst fears are confirmed.", "genres": ["Crime", "Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 75930, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 2513}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:49:46.670000000", "plot": "A New York detective investigates a series of murders committed by random New Yorkers who claim that \"God told them to.\"", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgxNTM2ZjAtNDg5Ni00MDM4LTk0YzYtYmVmMjUwZjZiNWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 300499200000, "runtime": 91, "title": "God Told Me To", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 9, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1061856000000, "fresh": 7, "lastUpdated": 1441217153000, "production": "Unknown", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 1914, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Larry Cohen (original screenplay)"], "year": 1976}
