One shoots, the other drives. Until 1944, they kill only Danes; then Winther gives orders to kill Germans. When a target tells Bent that Winther's using them to settle private scores, doubt sets in, complicated by Bent's relationship with the mysterious Kitty Selmer, who may be a double agent. Also, someone in their circle is a traitor. Can Bent and J\u00e8rgen kill an \u00e8ber-target, evade capture, and survive the war? And is this heroism, naivet\u00e8, or mere hatred?", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 920458, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 13156}, "languages": ["Danish", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 00:22:48.730000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A drama centered on two fighters in the Holger Danske World War II resistance group.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTI5MjI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0NTY3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1206662400000, "runtime": 130, "title": "Flame and Citron", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The true story of the Danish resistance in WW2, though lengthy and sprawling, is gripping and competently made.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 70, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1266883200000, "fresh": 61, "lastUpdated": 1440353545000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 4917, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lars Andersen", "Ole Christian Madsen"], "year": 2008}
