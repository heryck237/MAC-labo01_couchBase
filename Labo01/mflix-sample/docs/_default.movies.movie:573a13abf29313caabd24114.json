It's the week of the poker world series, and Huck must come up with the $10,000 entry fee, which he wins, loses, borrows, and loses - and even steals part of from Billie Offer, an earnest young woman who's new in town and who catches Huck's eye. By the time the tournament starts, Huck owes everyone. Complicating things is the arrival of Huck's father, whom Huck detests for having left his mother, a champion player in town to win. Can Huck learn to play poker the way he lives and to live the way he plays poker? Or is his only flush the sound of his life going down the toilet?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 338216, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 17681}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:21:23.817000000", "metacritic": 49, "plot": "A hotshot poker player tries to win a tournament in Vegas, but is fighting a losing battle with his personal problems.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcyMzgwNzU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcyODYzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1178236800000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Lucky You", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$5.7M", "consensus": "Lucky You tries to combine a romantic story with the high-stakes world of poker, but comes up with an empty hand.", "critic": {"meter": 29, "numReviews": 141, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1190073600000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1440964889000, "production": "Warner Bros.
