Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1454029, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 285527}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:00:31.653000000", "metacritic": 62, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5OTMyMjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU4MjIwNQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1312934400000, "runtime": 146, "title": "The Help", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$169.7M", "consensus": "Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, The Help rises on the strength of its cast -- particularly Viola Davis, whose performance is powerful enough to carry the film on its own.", "critic": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 203, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1323129600000, "fresh": 154, "lastUpdated": 1441905174000, "production": "DreamWorks Studios", "rotten": 49, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 105134, "rating": 4.2}, "website": "http://www.thehelpmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tate Taylor (screenplay)", "Kathryn Stockett (novel)"], "year": 2011}
