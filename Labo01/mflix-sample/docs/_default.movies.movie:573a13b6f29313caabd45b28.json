Then, he loses his testicles in an assault and gets a letter saying he's to become a father. He can't remember the woman and asks if she'll meet with him: she's Ginger, a solitary waspish woman about his age. He acknowledges paternity and wants to be a part of the pregnancy and parenthood. With reluctance and lots of put-downs, Ginger introduces him to her family, including the favored younger sister, and allows him to come with her to her doctor's. With his own father issues, a canny boss, brittle Ginger, and her vampy sister, can Barry hang in there?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 482461, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 3353}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:10:26.087000000", "metacritic": 28, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Barry Munday wakes up after being attacked to realize that he's missing his family jewels.
