Her idea begins as flawed spectacle, faced with governmental, religious, and military blockade. But with each roadblock comes a more refined mission, until Rebecca realizes she can use new technologies to bypass law - and train women to give themselves abortions using WHO-researched protocols with pills. From there we witness her create an underground network of emboldened, informed activists who trust women to handle abortion themselves. Vessel is Rebecca's story: one of a woman who hears and answers a calling, and transforms a wildly improbable idea into a global movement.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Adventure", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 3311588, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 84}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:20:28.313000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A fearless sea captain sails a ship through loopholes in international law, providing abortions on the high seas, and leaving in her wake a network of emboldened activists who trust women to handle abortion on their own terms.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NDI3MDMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ5NzM4MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1424995200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Vessel", "type": "movie", "year": 2014}
