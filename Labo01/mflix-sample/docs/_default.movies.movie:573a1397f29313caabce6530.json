A woman called Dahlia is the one overseeing the operation. She was in the Middle East with the other members of the organization, discussing the operation when some Israelis came in; the leader, Major Kobakov had his gun on her but didn't shoot her. Kobakov then informed the US what they found. Though they don't know what their operation is, Kobakov assures them that it will be devastating. So, with FBI man, Corley, they try to find out what it is before it's too late. But they both have different ways of doing things, and since Kobakov is the visitor, he is warned to watch it. Dahlia's \"partner in crime\" is Michael Lander, a Vietnam P.O.W., who is psychologically scarred by that experience, thus making him very susceptible to her machinations.", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 75765, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 4862}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:59:17.727000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Black Sunday is the powerful story of a Black September terrorist group attempting to blow up a Goodyear blimp hovering over the Super Bowl stadium with 80,000 people and the president of the United States in attendance.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIzMWNlMDEtNDllYi00YmZlLWE2ZGQtMTJlMDgyZDY2YzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 226886400000, "runtime": 143, "title": "Black Sunday", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1066089600000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1440612074000, "production": "Anchor Bay Entertainment", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 3849, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thomas Harris (novel)", "Ernest Lehman (screenplay)", "Kenneth Ross (screenplay)", "Ivan Moffat (screenplay)"], "year": 1977}
