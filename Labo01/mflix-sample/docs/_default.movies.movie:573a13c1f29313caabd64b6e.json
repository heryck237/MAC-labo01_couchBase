He visits Bronner Brothers' annual hair convention in Atlanta. He tells us about sodium hydroxide, a toxin used to relax hair. He looks at weaves, and he travels to India where tonsure ceremonies produce much of the hair sold in America. A weave is expensive: he asks who makes the money. We visit salons and barbershops, central to the Black community. Rock asks men if they can touch their mates' hair - no, it's decoration. Various talking heads (many of them women with good hair) comment. It's about self image. Maya Angelou and Tracie Thoms provide perspective.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1213585, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 4554}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 01:02:40.283000000", "metacritic": 72, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Chris Rock explores the wonders of African-American hairstyles.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mjk3OTgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgwOTg3Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1256256000000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Good Hair", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$4.1M", "consensus": "Funny, informative, and occasionally sad, Good Hair is a provocative look at the complex relationship between African Americans and their hair.", "critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 80, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1266278400000, "fresh": 76, "lastUpdated": 1440098130000, "production": "Roadside Attractions", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 49090, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.goodhairmovie.net/site/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lance Crouther", "Paul Marchand (ghostwriter)", "Chris Rock", "Chuck Sklar", "Jeff Stilson"], "year": 2009}
