In flashbacks we see that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a dot.com millionaire, she's a lap dancer at a club. He's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. He wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Vegas, and she accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration. During the days in Vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, meet a friend of hers; at night, at least after the first night, things seem to get complicated. Is mutual attraction stirring? Will they play by their rules? Can it be about more than money?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 240402, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 3916}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:47:41.750000000", "metacritic": 44, "plot": "A couple checks into a suite in Las Vegas.
