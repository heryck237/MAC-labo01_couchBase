With a few weeks spent reading a library of self-help manuals, Placid has it all sorted out--and he has the haircut and the cheap suit to prove it. Can Placid Lake retire his rage in the pursuit of beige; embrace conformity and leap on the fast track to corporate success. Will his 'brainiac' friend Gemma be able to talk him out of this economic rationalist madness? And will poor Doug and Sylvia survive the ignominy of having a son with a burgeoning future in insurance? Never underestimate the evil of banality.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 305999, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 2479}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:27:10.040000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An exuberant, sharply satirical comedy about two parentally neglected teenagers who find the courage to believe in themselves", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4Njg1MTA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIwODc0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1062028800000, "runtime": 89, "title": "The Rage in Placid Lake", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 15, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1145318400000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1442260792000, "production": "Film Movement", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 5479, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.filmmovement.com/FilmDetail.aspx?ProductID=0504"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tony McNamara"], "year": 2003}
