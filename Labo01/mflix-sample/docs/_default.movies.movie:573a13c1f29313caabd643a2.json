For the first time, we hear first-hand accounts of what transpired during Bias' final hours from those who were with him at the time of his death. His heartbreaking fall from grace changed the game forever...on the court, where many considered him to be Michael Jordan's closest rival...and in the courtroom, where generations continue to face the harsh punishment of the nation's drug policies that were influenced by his controversial death.
