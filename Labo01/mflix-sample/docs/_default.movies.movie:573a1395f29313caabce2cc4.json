Right beside her, though, is her best friend and Svengali, Alan. He helps her get 12 cashmere sweaters, a job in the principal's office, spring break at Balboa, and more. Along the way, the satire bites teen mores, beach-blanket bikini movies, adults in charge, the country-club set, Christian-youth programs, older men's fantasies, and teen girls' innocence. How popular will Barbara Ann become, and what lengths will Alan go to get her there?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 60636, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 1240}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:47:37.593000000", "plot": "A bright satirical comedy about an innocent high school girl granted her wishes by a student prodigy.
