He has announced that he's going to kill himself- on camera- for a class project. His classmates, parents, Sierra- the most beautiful girl in school, and a \"Shady Bunch\" of shrinks, doctors, pill-pushers, and counselors descend on Archie. Some are hoping to save him, some want to imitate him, others try to push him over the brink. Archie films every moment of his high school experience, hiding nothing from his audience: realities of life, death, violence, sex, drugs, and the intense media overload and hypocrisy that bombard all teenagers.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 492896, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1113}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:18:51.147000000", "plot": "A teen coming-of-age romantic dramedy about a media-obsessed geek and the most beautiful and twisted girl in school.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NzEzMTYxODZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDcyMTYxMjY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1316736000000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Archie's Final Project", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 5.5}, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1439406203000, "production": "Independent Pictures", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 1915, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.archiesfinalproject.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Eric J.
