When his bored, frustrated wife leaves him, he begins to eat dinner at the family-run Chinese take-out across the street. Working methodically through the numbered menu, he finds an unexpected friend in Feng, a genial man with his own concerns. Keld helps fix the plumbing in the diner, and then Feng asks for assistance with another problem: his Chinese sister requires a marriage of convenience to stay in Denmark. Enter Ling (Vivan Wu), a young woman who is not at all comfortable with this \"strictly pro-forma\" arrangement. Over time, Ling's gentle influence brings Keld into a world of tradition, full of surprising rewards and life-changing affection. This romantic tale has the fairy tale feel of what just might happen when people fall in love.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 414195, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1283}, "languages": ["Danish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:11:14.900000000", "plot": "In order to pay for his divorce, a plumber marries a Chinese woman who needs citizenship.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzQ3NjA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5MDg5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1112313600000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Chinaman", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1148342400000, "lastUpdated": 1434045958000, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 652, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kim Fupz Aakeson"], "year": 2005}
