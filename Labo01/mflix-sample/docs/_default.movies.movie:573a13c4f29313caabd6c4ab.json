It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1340800, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 136934}, "languages": ["English", "Russian", "Hungarian", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:15:54.477000000", "metacritic": 85, "plot": "In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2OTkwNzMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI4ODg2Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1325808000000, "runtime": 127, "title": "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$24.1M", "consensus": "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a dense puzzle of anxiety, paranoia, and espionage that director Tomas Alfredson pieces together with utmost skill.", "critic": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 207, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1332201600000, "fresh": 171, "lastUpdated": 1442086188000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 36, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 52269, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://TTSSmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bridget O'Connor (screenplay)", "Peter Straughan (screenplay)", "John le Carr\u00e8 (novel)"], "year": 2011}
