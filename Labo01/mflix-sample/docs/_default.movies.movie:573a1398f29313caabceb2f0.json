In 1941, her husband Paul returns from German captivity, too weak to hold a job. Marie discovers she can make money performing abortions, using a soapy water douche. Many of her clients are knocked up by occupying Germans. She buys better food and clothes, looks for a new flat, and, through an acquaintance, who is a prostitute, rents out her bedrooms to hookers during the day. She's indifferent to Paul; his humiliations grow as does her income. She hopes to be a singer. Male Vichy umbrage and moral hypocrisy may upend her. What is she thinking?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 96336, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 2456}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:37.690000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Marie Latour, a woman of limited schooling, raises two children in a ratty flat during World War II in occupied France.
