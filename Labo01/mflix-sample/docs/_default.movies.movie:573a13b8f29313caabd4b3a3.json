His pledge gets televised, so when John returns to San Francisco - where his old job and girl-friend evaporate - his friends expect him to deliver on the promise. He gets a call from marryacanadian.ca, accepts their invitation to come to Winnipeg, interviews traveling companions, picks Chloe (she with a nose ring), and sets out. Both John and Chloe have secrets, revealed one at a time, and Winnipeg in 2004, with men and women willing to help US ex-pats gain citizenship, may not be what either needs. Echoes of the Vietnam war help them decide.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 780486, "rating": 6, "votes": 1892}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:25:28.997000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "BLUE STATE is a romantic comedy about a disgruntled Democrat who actually follows through on a drunken campaign promise to move to Canada if George \"Dubya\" Bush gets re-elected.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NjAwNDA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU1MzU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1203379200000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Blue State", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1202774400000, "fresh": 2, "lastUpdated": 1442255632000, "production": "Fox Home Entertainment", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 34, "numReviews": 1773, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://www.bluestatemovie.com/Blue%20State/Blue%20State.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marshall Lewy"], "year": 2007}
