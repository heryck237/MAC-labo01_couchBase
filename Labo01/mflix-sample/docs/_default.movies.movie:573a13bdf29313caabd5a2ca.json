He starts boxing while at a state detention center; his coach there sends him to Cus D'Amato who becomes trainer, father figure, and confidence builder. Tyson wins a series of championships and, for six years, is unbeatable. A failed marriage, a felony conviction, and lack of training lead to his fall. We see later losing fights and archive footage of other incidents in his life. Tyson concludes by speaking philosophically about being a father and trying to be a better person.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 1032821, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 10341}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:41:30.917000000", "metacritic": 83, "plot": "A mixture of original interviews and archival footage and photographs sheds light on the life experiences of Mike Tyson.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0NjM1MTQzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE3MTA0Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1242345600000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Tyson", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.8M", "consensus": "A fascinating, emotional, and frank confessional from Iron Mike that sheds a sympathetic light on one of boxing's most controversial icons.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 136, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1250553600000, "fresh": 115, "lastUpdated": 1442428004000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 21, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 6877, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/tyson/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["James Toback"], "year": 2008}
