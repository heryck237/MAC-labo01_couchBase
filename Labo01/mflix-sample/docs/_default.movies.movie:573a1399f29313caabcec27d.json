Freeing her, he gains a close friendship with the bird. However, Cody is soon abducted by the murderous poacher, Percival McLeach, who is after that bird which is of a highly endangered species and therefore an extremely profitable quarry. In a panic, a mouse Cody freed from one of McLeach's traps sends a desperate call for help to the Rescue Aid Society in New York City who assigns their top agents, Miss Bianca and Bernard, to the task. With transportation provided by the goofy albatross, Wilbur, the agents arrive in Australia and link up with the RAS' local field operative, Jake the Kangaroo Rat. Together, the trio must race against time to find Cody, stop McLeach, and save Marahute.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 100477, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 24223}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 17:29:05.883000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The R.A.S. agents, Miss Bianca and Bernard, race to Australia to save a boy and a rare golden eagle from a murderous poacher.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY1OWZkMjQtMDY0YS00ZGRiLTg1YjktMzlmZWQyZWMzZGI1L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 658713600000, "runtime": 77, "title": "The Rescuers Down Under", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Though its story is second-rate, The Rescuers Down Under redeems itself with some remarkable production values -- particularly its flight scenes.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 25, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 864086400000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1442251747000, "production": "Silver Screen Partners IV", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 81604, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jim Cox (animation screenplay)", "Karey Kirkpatrick (animation screenplay)", "Byron Simpson (animation screenplay)", "Joe Ranft (animation screenplay)", "Joe Ranft (story)", "Margery Sharp (characters)"], "year": 1990}
