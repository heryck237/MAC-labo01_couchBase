There's a story of a teenage boy who meets the wrong girl. Another tale deals with a small community where people disappear and are never seen again. Then there's the narrative of a little Japanese girl who suffers from horrible nightmares followed by a tale where a man doesn't get the rest he hoped for in an old not-so-abandoned house. These stories are connected by the story about a man with a devilish smile and four enormous dogs from hell and by a woman's monologue about her fears.", "genres": ["Animation", "Drama", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 792986, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2426}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 01:05:30.147000000", "metacritic": 69, "plot": "Several scary black-and-white animated segments in different styles appeal to our fear(s) of the dark.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwOTczMjQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI3MTI5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1202860800000, "runtime": 83, "title": "Peur(s) du noir", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "This French animated horror portmanteau is monochrome and minimalist, visually stunning, but light on scares.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 66, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1242086400000, "fresh": 48, "lastUpdated": 1442163750000, "production": "IFC", "rotten": 18, "viewer": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 2441, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.primalinea.com/pdn/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Blutch", "Charles Burns", "Pierre Di Sciullo", "Jerry Kramski", "Richard McGuire", "Michel Pirus", "Romain Slocombe"], "year": 2007}
