Miro, a teen from Sarajevo, lives near King's Cross with his mother; he's nimble, able to run across roofs, so his uncle hires him to break into office skylights, so the uncle can boost computers. Twice they steal from Will's architectural firm, so Will stakes it out at night. He follows Miro home and returns the next day and meets Miro's mother, Amira. At home, Will's relationship with Liv is strained - he feels outside Liv and her daughter Bea's circle. The stakeout and Amira's vulnerability are attractive alternatives to being at home. The police, too, watch Miro.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 443456, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 19419}, "languages": ["English", "Serbo-Croatian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:37:25.030000000", "metacritic": 56, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A landscape architect's dealings with a young thief cause him to re-evaluate his life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NzM3NDU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYzODgzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1163116800000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Breaking and Entering", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.9M", "consensus": "This class warfare drama feels contrived and superficial: characters don't act logically as the movie manipulates them towards deconstructing various social issues.", "critic": {"meter": 34, "numReviews": 127, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1178582400000, "fresh": 43, "lastUpdated": 1441130876000, "production": "The Weinstein Company", "rotten": 84, "viewer": {"meter": 52, "numReviews": 57428, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.weinsteinco.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anthony Minghella"], "year": 2006}
