There are no suspects. With Harper Lee, he visits the town: he wants to write about their response. First he must get locals to talk, then, after arrests, he must gain access to the prisoners. One talks constantly; the other, Perry Smith, says little. Capote is implacable, wanting the story, believing this book will establish a new form of reportage: he must figure out what Perry wants. Their relationship becomes something more than writer and character: Perry killed in cold blood, the state will execute him in cold blood; does Capote get his story through cold calculation, or is there a price for him to pay?", "genres": ["Biography", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 420609, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 13561}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:01:32.567000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "While researching his book In Cold Blood, writer Truman Capote develops a close relationship with convicted murderers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NTAyODYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0MDczMjI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1160697600000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Infamous", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.1M", "consensus": "Though comparisons with last year's Capote may be inevitable, Infamous takes a different angle in its depiction of the author, and stands up well enough on its own.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 146, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1171324800000, "fresh": 106, "lastUpdated": 1440613498000, "production": "Warner Independent Pictures", "rotten": 40, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 20596, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.infamousmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Douglas McGrath (screenplay)", "George Plimpton (book)"], "year": 2006}
