Thus she will be able to feed her 6 brothers/sisters. However the islanders do not trust a woman to carry them: they prefer her father's competitor, another boatman. The priest of the village helps her and arranges so that during epiphany, she is the one that catches the cross. Thus, public opinion turns to her favor: she is now \"blessed\". In a little while, the competitor brings a machine boat and the villagers forget the \"blessed\", who has no customers. In despair, Madalena decides to marry someone she doesn't love, while in reality she loves the son of the other boatman. The priest once more plays a significant role. He intercedes and the right couple get married: Voygiouklaki and Papamihael.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 55119, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 523}, "languages": ["Greek"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:16:42.040000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young and brave girl after her father's death decides to continue her father's trade, carrying people and things with his boat.
