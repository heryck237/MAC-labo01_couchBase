Although the storm was damaging by itself, that was not the true disaster. That happened when the city's flooding safeguards like levees failed and put most of the city, which is largely below sea level, underwater. This film covers that disastrous series of events that devastated the city and its people. Furthermore, the gross incompetence of the various governments and the powerful from the local to the federal level is examined to show how the poor and underprivileged of New Orleans were mistreated in this grand calamity and still ignored today.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 783612, "rating": 8.6, "votes": 3463}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:26:49.057000000", "plot": "An examination of the U.S. government's role and its response to Hurricane Katrina.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTg2ODQ5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk2NTE0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-MA", "released": 1165968000000, "runtime": 255, "title": "When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 97, "numReviews": 30, "rating": 8.2}, "dvd": 1166486400000, "fresh": 29, "lastUpdated": 1440096445000, "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 5713, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2006}
