But before he was famous, before WikiLeaks, before the internet even existed, he was a teenage computer hacker in Melbourne. This is his story. In 1989, known as 'Mendax', Assange and two friends formed a group called the 'International Subversives'. Using early home computers and defining themselves as 'white hat hackers' - those who look but don't steal - they broke into some of the world's most powerful and secretive organisations. They were young, brilliant, and in the eyes of the US Government, a major threat to national security. At the urging of the FBI, the Australian Federal Police set up a special taskforce to catch them. But at a time when most Australian police had never seen a computer, let alone used one, they had to figure out just where to begin. Police ingenuity and old-fashioned detective work are pitted against nimble, highly skilled young men in this new crime frontier. What follows, is a tense and gripping game of cat and mouse through the electronic underground of Melbourne.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2357453, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 1336}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:25:12.470000000", "plot": "A look at the early career of Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMTg4MTIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUwNDM1MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1349568000000, "runtime": 89, "title": "Underground: The Julian Assange Story", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1441303838000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 19, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/UndergroundTheMovie"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Suelette Dreyfus (book)", "Robert Connolly (adaptation)"], "year": 2012}
