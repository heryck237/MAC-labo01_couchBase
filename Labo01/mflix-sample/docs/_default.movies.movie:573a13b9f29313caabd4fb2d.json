Mistrust and dislike of the situation makes Rick anything but a model prisoner, but counselors at the center nonetheless hook him up with the Highland Rugby Team, a team renowned for its long string of successive state championships. Its coach, Larry Gelwix, has a surprisingly unexpected philosophy: train boys to be champions in life first, then on the field. Rick doesn't buy into this, which could earn him some time in State Prison if he doesn't turn his life and attitude around by the time he turns 18.", "genres": ["Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 840322, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 8338}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 01:11:09.533000000", "metacritic": 37, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A rugby player is put up in a juvenile detention center.
