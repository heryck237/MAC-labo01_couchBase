Ryna has been brought up like a boy because her father had longed for a son. The film is about strong family ties, about gender identity, and about a despotic father slowly losing his grip. But, it is also about poverty, social suppression and the abuse of power. Ryna shows the awakening of a young girl's soul and the pain that goes with it. Caught between traditional values and materialistic dreams, in the end Ryna pays a heavy price in order to assert her own identity.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 449642, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 385}, "languages": ["French", "Romanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:38:28.070000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In a small community in the Danube Delta that wavers between old traditions and new material aspirations, a teenager, Ryna, pays a heavy price in a search of her own identity.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNjUxODY1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ0MjMzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1164326400000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Ryna", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"numReviews": 4}, "dvd": 1157414400000, "fresh": 3, "lastUpdated": 1423380853000, "production": "Indie Crush", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 322, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marek Epstein", "Andreea Valean (dialogue adaptation)", "Ruxandra Zenide"], "year": 2005}
