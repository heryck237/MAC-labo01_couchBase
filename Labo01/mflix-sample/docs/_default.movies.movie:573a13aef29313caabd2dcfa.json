With an extra man looking after base camp, Simon and Joe set off to scale the mount in one long push over several days. The peak is reached, however on the descent Joe falls and breaks his leg. Despite what it means, the two continue with Simon letting Joe out on a rope for 300 meters, then descending to join him and so on. However when Joe goes out over an overhang with no way of climbing back up, Simon makes the decision to cut the rope. Joe falls into a crevasse and Simon, assuming him dead, continues back down. Joe however survives the fall and was lucky to hit a ledge in the crevasse. This is the story of how he got back down.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Adventure", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 379557, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 24185}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:29:40.690000000", "metacritic": 82, "plot": "The true story of two climbers and their perilous journey up the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3NGVhNjQtYTQ3YS00MTFkLThjZjYtYWZhMWMyNTczOGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1079049600000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Touching the Void", "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Darlow (script writer)", "Joe Simpson (book)"], "year": 2003}
