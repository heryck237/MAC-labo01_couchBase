A child goes missing in West Yorkshire, one of several over ten years; the police find a patsy, an acquaintance of Michael, a blood simple man serving a life sentence for another girl's death. Michael's mother asks John Piggott, a burned-out solicitor, to look into her son's conviction; Piggott finds injustices in current and past cases. Maurice Jobson, part of a group of corrupt cops, searches for the missing girl, involves a medium, finds nothing, leans hard on Piggott, and may be tiring of the sham. He's warned off going soft. Is there moral strength anywhere capable of facing down the cabal?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 1259573, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 5468}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:13:44.110000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Plagued by guilt, a corrupt police official attempts to solve the case of a missing schoolgirl after seeing connections between her disappearance and a rash of prior abductions.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NTY0ODM4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMzMzExMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1257897600000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Red Riding: In the Year of Our Lord 1983", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 10, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1277942400000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1442343675000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 1478, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.channel4.com/programmes/red-riding"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Peace (novel)", "Tony Grisoni (screenplay)"], "year": 2009}
