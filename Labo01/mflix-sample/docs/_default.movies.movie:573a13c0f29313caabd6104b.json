We meet DAM, a '48 group, led by Tamer Nafar; three young women who perform to rousing applause but objection from some family members and neighbors; and PR, an emerging trio from Gaza. They see rap as a way to channel anger. The camera observes them composing and performing, going to gigs, and walking the streets of Tel Aviv and Gaza. Israel's military presence is extensive: for instance, will PR be allowed to travel from Gaza to a concert in Ramallah, even with proper papers? Cell phones and the Internet link friends across walls, checkpoints, and barbed wire.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 1157718, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 114}, "languages": ["Arabic", "English", "Hebrew"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-25 00:19:47.550000000", "plot": "The voice of a new generation rocks and rhymes as Palestinian rappers form alternative voices of resistance within the Israeli-Palestinian struggle.", "released": 1386979200000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Slingshot Hip Hop", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1436641224000, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 221, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.slingshothiphop.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2008}
