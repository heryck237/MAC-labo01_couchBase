While changing planes, a blizzard moves in and cancels all flights out of Hoover Airport: they must stay in a basement room with the other unaccompanied minors. Spencer and four others - a chubby boy, a non-stop-talker, a surly girl, and a rich kid - go AWOL and get in trouble with Mr. Porter, the Christmas-hating airport supervisor. The five misfits spend the night evading and enduring Porter's punishments, discovering all sorts of things in back rooms, making sure Katherine gets her visit from Santa, and finding among themselves a new kind of family.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 488658, "rating": 5, "votes": 7856}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:17:28.510000000", "metacritic": 43, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A group of unaccompanied minors bond while snowed in at the midwestern Hoover International Airport during the holiday season and ultimately create a makeshift holiday themselves.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDY2NDYwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc5OTYzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1165536000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Unaccompanied Minors", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$16.6M", "consensus": "Unaccompanied Minors, while featuring credible performances by its mostly young cast, is simply a rehash of other, funnier movies.", "critic": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 87, "rating": 4.5}, "dvd": 1186444800000, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1442337302000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 60, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 45364, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://unaccompaniedminors.warnerbros.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jacob Meszaros", "Mya Stark"], "year": 2006}
