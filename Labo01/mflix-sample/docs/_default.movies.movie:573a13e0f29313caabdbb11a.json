No sooner do these treatments start (somewhat unorthodox in nature) that Basia's flashbacks caused during regression appear to be not only of a troubled childhood but also of troubled past lives. As these \"memories\" gush forth, the vivid and warm memories of her young mother's kindness subside and start to give way to dark forces that seek to disrupt and destroy her. As Basia struggles to hold these dark forces from breaking through into her present, she increasingly struggles to retain her sanity and the ability to fight back. There is a way out but it is hardest path to take, shaking her humanity to the very core.", "genres": ["Horror", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 2673388, "rating": 4.4, "votes": 377}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:40:52.033000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Reincarnation goes horribly wrong releasing dark forces across time.
