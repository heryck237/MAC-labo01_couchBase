Hefner", "Rebecca Romijn"], "countries": ["USA"], "directors": ["Mark Mori"], "fullplot": "With a natural photogenic poise and a vivaciously innocent risqu\u00e8 flair, there never was a pinup model like Bettie Page. Through Page's own words and interviews with her closest associates, we explore her extraordinary life growing up in a troubled childhood until she found a wild career as the Queen of the Pin-up Girls. In doing so, Page would challenge the paranoid sexual repression of the 1950s with uncommon grace until she walked away at the peak of her career. We also follow her quiet troubled later years struggling with unhappy marriages and mental illness that threaten to consume her even as she found a higher faith. Despite those challenges, Page's popularity would rise again in a more accepting time to become a celebrated icon of fearless sexuality and beauty.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1776086, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 887}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:06:59.410000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The world's greatest pinup model and cult icon, Bettie Page, recounts the true story of how her free expression overcame government witch-hunts to help launch America's sexual revolution.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MTY3MTA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3MTI1NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1385078400000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Bettie Page Reveals All", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.1M", "critic": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 36, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1398124800000, "fresh": 26, "lastUpdated": 1440442648000, "production": "Music Box Films", "rotten": 10, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 1587, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://bettiepagemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Douglas Miller"], "year": 2012}
