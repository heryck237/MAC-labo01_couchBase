This feature follows the heroic lives of a world leader and a young man swept up in the horrors of WWII. Both men are from Hungary--a country and German ally that had been spared the atrocities orchestrated by Hitler throughout much of Europe. As the war reaches its climax, Germany begins to doubt the loyalties of the Hungarian leadership-in particular Regent Horthy (Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley). The Regent tries to navigate his country between the growing terror of Nazi Germany and the oppressive threat of communist Russia. He is ultimately faced with ceding power to another political party or accepting the execution of his son. As the crisis unfolds, thousands of his citizens are forced underground or put into ghettos. One of them is a young man named Elek Cohen (Jonas Armstrong) who is separated from his family and determined to find them. Aided by the woman he loves (Hannah Tointon), Elek disguises himself as a Nazi SS officer and discovers the truth of Hitler's \"Final Solution.\" In a race against time to save his family and thousands of his countrymen, he embarks on a journey filled with suspense and danger. An inspirational film of love, war, and sacrifice, WALKING WITH THE ENEMY is an unforgettable experience for audiences.", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1515208, "rating": 5.4, "votes": 435}, "languages": ["English", "German", "Hungarian", "Romanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:46:10.970000000", "metacritic": 44, "plot": "A young man, separated from his family in WWII, disguises himself as a Nazi SS Officer and uncovers more than just his family whereabouts.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwOTg4MDg0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI1NzQyMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1381622400000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Walking with the Enemy", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.4M", "consensus": "While Walking With the Enemy tells a stirring and little-known true story, it's ultimately too heavy-handed to fully resonate.", "critic": {"meter": 44, "numReviews": 36, "rating": 5.4}, "fresh": 16, "lastUpdated": 1440615587000, "production": "Liberty Studios", "rotten": 20, "viewer": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 1366, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.walkingwiththeenemy.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kenny Golde (screenplay)", "Richard Lasser (additional screenplay material)"], "year": 2013}
