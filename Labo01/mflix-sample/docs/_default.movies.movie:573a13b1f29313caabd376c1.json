The new album was to be called \"SMiLE\". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 421696, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 244}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-15 00:34:20.080000000", "plot": "Interviews with Beach Boy Brian Wilson and his contemporaries outline the history of Wilson's album \"Smile,\" a project some 37 years in the making.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDIwMDI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgwMTkyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-14", "released": 1096934400000, "title": "Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of 'Smile'", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439665900000, "production": "Imageworks Entertainbment", "viewer": {"meter": 51, "numReviews": 298, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2004}
