John Smith leads a rag-tag band of English sailors & soldiers to the New World to plunder its riches for England (or, more precisely, for Governor Ratcliffe, who comes along for the ride). Meanwhile, in this \"New World,\" Chief Powhatan has pledged his daughter, Pocahontas, to be married to the village's greatest warrior. Pocahontas, however, has other ideas. She has seen a vision of a spinning arrow, a vision she believes tells her change is coming. Her life does indeed change when the English ship lands near her village. Between Ratcliffe, who believes the \"savages\" are hiding the gold he expected to be plentiful, and Powhatan, who believes these pale newcomers will destroy their land, Smith and Pocahontas have a difficult time preventing all-out war, and saving their love for each other.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 114148, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 104926}, "languages": ["English", "Algonquin"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:17:29.643000000", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An English soldier and the daughter of an Algonquin chief share a romance when English colonists invade seventeenth-century Virginia.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc4YzhiN2ItY2Y4NC00YTA0LWEyMjEtNzllNTcxZDdjODhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 803865600000, "runtime": 81, "title": "Pocahontas", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Pocahontas means well, and has moments of startling beauty, but it's largely a bland, uninspired effort, with uneven plotting and an unfortunate lack of fun.", "critic": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 52, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 960249600000, "fresh": 29, "lastUpdated": 1442080567000, "production": "Buena Vista Distribution Compa", "rotten": 23, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 559674, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Carl Binder", "Susannah Grant", "Philip LaZebnik", "Tom Sito (story)", "Glen Keane (story)", "Joe Grant (story)", "Ralph Zondag (story)", "Burny Mattinson (story)", "Ed Gombert (story)", "Kaan Kalyon (story)", "Francis Glebas (story)", "Rob Gibbs (story)", "Bruce Morris (story)", "Todd Kurosawa (story)", "Duncan Marjoribanks (story)", "Chris Buck (story)", "Andrew Chapman (additional story development)", "Randy Cartwright (additional story development)", "Will Finn (additional story development)", "Broose Johnson (additional story development)", "T.
