She doesn't want to travel by herself, but has no boyfriend and seems unable to meet new people. A friend takes her to Cherbourg; after a few days there, the weepy and self-pitying Delphine goes back to Paris. She tries the Alps, but returns the same day. Next, it's the beach: once there, she chats with an outgoing Swede, a party girl, and a friendship seems to bud; then, suddenly, Delphine bolts, heading back to Paris. As she waits at the Biarritz train station, a young man catches her eye; perhaps a sunset and the sun's green ray await.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 91830, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 3730}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 01:08:16.803000000", "plot": "It's July, and Delphine has nowhere to go for the summer.
