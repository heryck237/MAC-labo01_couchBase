Jace ends up in Athens, Greece, begging at street corners, exploring the secret horrors of brutal institutions for young offenders or, much later, serving obscure patrons, in an underworld where violent loss seems to be his only destiny. The movie follows Jace's inverted Odyssey in a dark universe of abuse, murder and fear, as he desperately (and silently) seeks for a \"family\" of his own or, at least, for a sense of belonging.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2075223, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 267}, "languages": ["Greek", "Albanian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-05 00:13:58.410000000", "plot": "Twice-orphaned Jace, a seven-year-old Albanian of Greek origin, witnesses a massacre that wipes out his entire foster family in Argyrokastron, and then falls in the hands of a bunch of ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODE0NzU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMwODY0OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1352332800000, "runtime": 142, "title": "J.A.C.E.", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440266614000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 20, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Menelaos Karamaghiolis", "Nicholas Panoutsopoulos"], "year": 2011}
