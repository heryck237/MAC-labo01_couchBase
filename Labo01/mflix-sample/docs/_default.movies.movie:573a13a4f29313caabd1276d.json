The official daily 'El Caribe' reports that it had been an accident, but it does not mention that a fourth sister lives. Nor does it mention the sisters' fierce opposition to the General Trujillo's dictatorship. This is their story: how Minerva started the tragedy by refusing Trujillo; how Patria became an opponent from the church itself; how Maria Teresa joined the revolution through the love. And how they lost their wings, but not their courage. They were Las Mariposas - \"The Butterflies\".", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 263467, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 1648}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:32:45.503000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the Time of the Butterflies is inspired by the true story of the three Mirabal sisters who, in 1960, were murdered for their part in an underground plot to overthrow the government.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNzc0NDExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYwOTAyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1092873600000, "runtime": 95, "title": "In the Time of the Butterflies", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1020729600000, "lastUpdated": 1437504796000, "production": "MGM", "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 3826, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Julia \u00e8lvarez (novel)", "Judy Klass (teleplay)", "David Klass (teleplay)"], "year": 2001}
