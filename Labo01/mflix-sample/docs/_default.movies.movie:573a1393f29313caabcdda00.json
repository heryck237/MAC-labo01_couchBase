It's a difficult journey and their new house is a ramshackle old building on the edge of a cliff that had been abandoned by a religious Brotherhood many years before. They soon establish a school and an infirmary though the local General's agent, Mr. Dean, warns them against treating the deathly ill as they would no doubt be blamed if the patient doesn't recover. The location, the culture and the mountain air all begin to have a strange effect on the Sisters. Sister Clodagh, who is also on her first assignment as Sister Superior, begins to remember a romance she had as a young woman before entering the sisterhood. Another however, becomes obsessed with Mr. Dean, which leads to tragedy.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 39192, "rating": 8, "votes": 14720}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:01:07.377000000", "plot": "After opening a convent in the Himalayas, five nuns encounter conflict and tension - both with the natives and also within their own group - as they attempt to adapt to their remote, exotic surroundings.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDQxMzg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY5NTY3MzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -696988800000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Black Narcissus", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 28, "rating": 8.8}, "dvd": 980812800000, "fresh": 28, "lastUpdated": 1441912066000, "production": "Universal International Pictur", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 6959, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Rumer Godden (adapted from the novel by)", "Michael Powell", "Emeric Pressburger"], "year": 1947}
