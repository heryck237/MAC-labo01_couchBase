It is a race against time for if he can't Tom within 24 hours and prove his case, he will be branded a fugitive and will be permanently disqualified for U.S. citizenship. His quest leads him to befriending Maggie, a down-on-her-luck factory worker whom he rejuvenates through his good faith; a visit to a jazz club where Shorty Rogers and his band and trombonist Jack Teagarden are playing, and an interlude with a good- hearted burlesque dancer, Tanya Zakoyla, takes him to her mother's home for food and rest. The climax comes at dawn in the United Nations building (the \"glass wall\" of the title) where he goes to plead his case and that of all displaced persons.", "genres": ["Drama", "Film-Noir"], "imdb": {"id": 45824, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 360}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:18:31.930000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Peter, a WW II 'displaced person' about to be deported jumps ship in New York harbor in an effort to find an ex-G.I named Tom whom he helped during the war and can prove Peter's right to ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMxYzUyMDUtMzdhOC00NTExLWJiZDktNTNjNTRhMzNhNTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -518227200000, "runtime": 82, "title": "The Glass Wall", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440613739000, "production": "Columbia Pictures", "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 179, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ivan Tors (screenplay)", "Maxwell Shane (screenplay)"], "year": 1953}
