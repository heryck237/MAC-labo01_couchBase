His family gathers around him, worried about his seeming impassivity before battle.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 1410261, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 2072}, "languages": ["Japanese", "Spanish", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-04 00:44:30.257000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A man wakes up alone in a brightly illuminated white room with no windows or doors.
