Isolated by their families, they furtively communicate by taking turns writing in a secret language, nu shu, between the folds of a white silk fan. In a parallel story in present day Shanghai, the laotong's descendants, Nina and Sophia, struggle to maintain the intimacy of their own childhood friendship in the face of demanding careers, complicated love lives, and a relentlessly evolving Shanghai. Drawing on the lessons of the past, the two modern women must understand the story of their ancestral connection, hidden from them in the folds of the antique white silk fan, or risk losing one another forever.", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1541995, "rating": 6, "votes": 2865}, "languages": ["English", "Chinese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:21:59.860000000", "metacritic": 42, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A story set in nineteenth-century China and focusing on the life-long friendship between two girls who develop their own secret code as a way to contend with the rigid social norms imposed on women.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NzEzNTYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU4MTA3NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1308873600000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.3M", "critic": {"meter": 21, "numReviews": 87, "rating": 4.5}, "dvd": 1320105600000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1440357131000, "production": "Fox Searchlight", "rotten": 69, "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 6378, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.foxsearchlight.com/snowflowerandthesecretfan/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Angela Workman (screenplay)", "Ronald Bass (screenplay)", "Michael Ray (screenplay)", "Lisa See (novel)"], "year": 2011}
