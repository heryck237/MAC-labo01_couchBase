She goes to a Snowy River resort where a vague job offer doesn't pan out. She manages to find a place to live and a job at a convenience store. She's between childhood -- nursery rimes and a scrapbook of glittery unicorns - and adulthood - working, sorting out emotions and sexuality, and dealing with social slights and false charges of bad behavior. She's attractive and her loneliness makes her vulnerable. She sleeps with Joe, the son of local ranchers, and she awakens in him feelings he can't express. Is there any way she can put off adulthood and be a kid awhile longer?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 381429, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 5987}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:57:50.947000000", "metacritic": 73, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "New experiences help a young girl learn the differences between sex and love.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MzQzMjc5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4MjQzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1095292800000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Somersault", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cate Shortland"], "year": 2004}
