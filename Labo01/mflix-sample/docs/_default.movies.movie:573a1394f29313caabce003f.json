A Mexican boy Michael Ray \"adopts\" Gitano after saving the animal's life during a storm. The friendship between bull and boy is threatened when Gitano's legal owners claim the animal and ship it off to the bullring. Moved by the boy's plight, the President of Mexico signs a \"pardon\" for Gitano - but not soon enough to prevent the bull's appearance at the Plaze de Mexico at Mexico City, where he faces top matador Fermin Rivera. Based on a true incident, the film earned a \"best story\" Academy Award for one Robert Rich - who, much to the embarrassment of the Academy (and the delight of civil libertarians) turned out to be blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 49030, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 315}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-10 00:01:34.620000000", "plot": "A young Mexican boy tirelessly tries to save his pet bull from death at the hands of a celebrated matador.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODA5MzEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODgzMzEzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -408412800000, "runtime": 100, "title": "The Brave One", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 872035200000, "lastUpdated": 1441912088000, "production": "VCI Entertainment", "viewer": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 938, "rating": 2.6}, "website": "http://www.vcientertainment.com/Film-Categories?product_id=254"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dalton Trumbo (story)", "Harry S.
