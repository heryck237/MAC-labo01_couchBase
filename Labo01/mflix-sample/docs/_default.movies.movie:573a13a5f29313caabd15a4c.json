Persuaded by Tom, the town agree to hide Grace, and in return she freely helps the locals. However, when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice, advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts, the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace, in return for their silence; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster, even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her, the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave. But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 276919, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 99963}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:27:10.327000000", "metacritic": 59, "plot": "A woman on the run from the mob is reluctantly accepted in a small Colorado town.
