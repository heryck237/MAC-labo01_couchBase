Adam Miauczynski, the character known from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 49 year-old teacher who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5 minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts with others cause his aggression.
