Well, not really that serene... Indeed, for several weeks, the children have been playing multiple practical jokes and nasty tricks. The victims are, of course, other children... but also, and most of all, the parents. Overwrought, they decide to leave the village for what they think will only be one day. But nothing happens as planned: on the way back, they are taken prisoner by a group of soldiers. In Timpelbach, the news of a village without parents makes Oscar and his gang of thugs happy! But that isn't the case of a few daredevils who decide to side with Manfred and Marianne to regain control of the village.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 953382, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 578}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:15:06.547000000", "plot": "The children of a small European mountain village end up being its only residents, soon after the adults cannot take their behavior any longer.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0NDA2NTQyMTJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjEwNjAx._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1229472000000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Les enfants de Timpelbach", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1441995811000, "production": "Pathe Cinema", "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 219, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://timpelbach-lefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Nicolas Bary", "Nicolas Peufaillit", "Fabrice Roger-Lacan", "Henry Winterfeld (novel)"], "year": 2008}
