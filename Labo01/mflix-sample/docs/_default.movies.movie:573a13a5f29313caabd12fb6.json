However, the original film shows how questionable evidence and a prejudiced community instead led to an apparent miscarriage of justice. The producers return to West Memphis to meet the Three again and the grassroots movement that has arisen to exonerate the Three. However, the father of one of the victims, John Mark Byers, is profiled as well as he belligerently asserts the three's guilt even as new evidence and his own criminal record draws suspicion on himself.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 239894, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 4326}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:58:43.293000000", "plot": "The case of the West Memphis Three, its questionable circumstances and the parties involved are followed up years later.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTQ1MzczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQxNjA5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 984355200000, "runtime": 130, "title": "Paradise Lost 2: Revelations", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1038268800000, "fresh": 10, "lastUpdated": 1441994214000, "production": "HBO Documentary Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 3501, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2000}
