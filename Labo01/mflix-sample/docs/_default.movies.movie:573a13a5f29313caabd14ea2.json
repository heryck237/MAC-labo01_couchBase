She spent six years on just the right interior and now hears from dad Don Keeble, a wimp whose 'career' in commercial publicity still only got him wearing sly costumes, a promotion requires the family to move to Chicago. Initially Max just hates giving up his high-school friends, a fatso and a music-maniac, but when their former friend Troy McGinty picks on them with his new image as bully realizes leaving means he can't be punished after Friday, and plans an orgy of revenge. Max's targets include the arrogant new principal, Elliot T. Jindraike, who spends the school budget on a new sports stadium to flatter the inspector, Superintendant Bobby 'Crazy Legs' Knebworth, and even plants to tear down the animal shelter. When it's all in motion, dad suddenly announces he has taken Max's first advice and turned down the promotion!", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 273799, "rating": 5.3, "votes": 5399}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:01:08.993000000", "metacritic": 40, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Max Keeble, the victim of his 7th grade class, plots revenge when he learns he's moving; it backfires when he doesn't move after all.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MzI5MTU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDg5MjQ3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1002240000000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Max Keeble's Big Move", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$16.5M", "consensus": "Max Keeble may be fun for kids, but bland and unoriginal for adults.", "critic": {"meter": 29, "numReviews": 56, "rating": 4.3}, "dvd": 1024358400000, "fresh": 16, "lastUpdated": 1442078945000, "production": "Buena Vista Pictures", "rotten": 40, "viewer": {"meter": 38, "numReviews": 19797, "rating": 2.7}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/maxkeeble"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David L.
