Using a dim-witted stunt man as their getaway driver and lookout, the three successfully pull off several jobs (even gaining the attention of a television show about American criminals), and become known as \"The Sleepover Bandits.\" Things are going great until the bank managers begin to realize that the robbers are non-violent and therefore no threat to them or their employees, changing the game for the Bandits. To add to the complications, a bored & unhappy housewife (Blanchett) ends up in the hands of the criminals, and begins to have romantic feelings for both Willis and Thornton, causing a sticky love triangle.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 219965, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 54182}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 01:12:32.063000000", "metacritic": 60, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Two bank robbers fall in love with the girl they've kidnapped.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzA3OTI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjU0ODM3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1002844800000, "runtime": 123, "title": "Bandits", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$41.2M", "consensus": "The story may not warrant its lengthy running time, but the cast of Bandits makes it an enjoyable ride.", "critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 139, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1017705600000, "fresh": 90, "lastUpdated": 1439838598000, "production": "MGM Pictures", "rotten": 49, "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 58558, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.mgm.com/bandits"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Harley Peyton"], "year": 2001}
