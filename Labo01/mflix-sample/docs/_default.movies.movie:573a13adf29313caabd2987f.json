We know this from a glimpse of a license plate, the craftsman architecture of the two houses, and the mature, rich landscapes in between. The setting, like the scrutiny of the four main character's lives, is defined by the narrowness of the camera's field-of view. The one commercial street in town is only seen in the reflection of a store window, a shot of a non-descript auto-yard, or the tunnel of a tree-lined suburban sidewalk. The lush, wooded landscape is understood as an immediate presence in the domestic and professional lives of the characters; a steep hill, railroad tracks, a rushing stream, and a path over an old steel bridge are revisited again and again by the characters in their capacities as lovers, parents and friends.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 361309, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 7928}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:49:18.087000000", "metacritic": 66, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An indiscretion between two close friends tears down their respective marriages.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MTA4MjAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNjYyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1094169600000, "runtime": 101, "title": "We Don't Live Here Anymore", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.9M", "consensus": "We Don't Live Here Anymore is often overly moody and grim, but it's made watchable by the strong performances for its four principal actors.", "critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 123, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1102982400000, "fresh": 80, "lastUpdated": 1441909258000, "production": "Warner Independent", "rotten": 43, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 8710, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.wedontlivehereanymore.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Andre Dubus (short stories \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" and \"Adultery\")", "Larry Gross (screenplay)"], "year": 2004}
