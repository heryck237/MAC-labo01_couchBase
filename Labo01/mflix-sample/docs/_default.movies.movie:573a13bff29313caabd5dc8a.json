A scientist studies neutrinos, which are everywhere, yet elusive; he likens them to spirits. A researcher's nighttime performance art includes contorting her body into a luggage bag. A survival guide teaches his students to survive white-out conditions by wearing cartoon-face buckets over their heads. Animal researchers milk mother seals as part of their study. Volcanologists offer advice on what to do when a volcano erupts. A pipefitter shows us the anomaly in his hands that he says are a sign he descended from Atzec royalty. A former Colorado banker drives what he has christened Ivan the Terra Bus. An underwater diver shows his colleagues DVDs of apocalyptic sci-fi films like Them! (1954). And -- though Herzog declares he's not \"making another film about penguins\" -- we meet a penguin researcher who answers the filmmaker's questions about homosexuality and insanity in his subjects. We also meet an individualist penguin, who breaks away from the other birds to run toward the mountains, facing certain death.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1093824, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 12663}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 00:21:56.100000000", "metacritic": 80, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Film-maker Werner Herzog travels to the McMurdo Station in Antarctica, looking to capture the continent's beauty and investigate the characters living there.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3NjkyNjY2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTUwMTU3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 1216339200000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Encounters at the End of the World", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.7M", "consensus": "Encounters at the End of the World offers a poignant study of the human psyche amid haunting landscapes.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 108, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1226966400000, "fresh": 101, "lastUpdated": 1442086545000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 35425, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://encountersfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Werner Herzog"], "year": 2007}
