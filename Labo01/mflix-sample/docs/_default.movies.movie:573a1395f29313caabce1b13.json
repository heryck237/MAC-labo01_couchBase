His impending absence strains his already nearly wordless relationship with Liliana, his fianc\u00e8e. They meet regularly at a dance hall and sometimes go riding on his motorcycle.

He hasn't been entirely faithful. There's pain and detachment in her eyes. Across this distance, can anything bring about a breakthrough? Do they have a future?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 55981, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1100}, "languages": ["Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 01:11:40.697000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the industrial North, Giovanni is a skilled factory worker offered a promotion if he'll go to Sicily for 18 months to assist in a new department.
