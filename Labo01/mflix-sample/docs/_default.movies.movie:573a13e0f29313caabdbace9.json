He engages inexperienced young producer Verity Lambert to expand the idea. Fighting sexist and racial bigotry Verity and young Indian director Waris Hussein persuade crusty character actor William Hartnell to play the doctor figure and, despite technical hiccups and competition with coverage of the Kennedy assassination, the first episode of 'Doctor Who' is born. As the show becomes a success Hartnell displays an obsession with his character but, after three years, ill health catches up with him and he starts to forget lines. Newman tells him that Doctor Who will 'regenerate' and he will be replaced by younger actor Patrick Troughton. Though attached to the part and reluctant to give it up Hartnell wishes every success to Troughton, the first of several actors to play a part which will endure for fifty years.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 2663812, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 4159}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:41:09.977000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A dramatization of the conception, birth and early years of Doctor Who (1963), with the story revolving around BBC executive Sydney Newman, novice producer Verity Lambert and actor William Hartnell.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NTA4OTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MTM3MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1385078400000, "runtime": 90, "title": "An Adventure in Space and Time", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1413833618000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 0, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Gatiss"], "year": 2013}
