He cares for a brother who's paraplegic, and he has a girlfriend, Sally, who wants out of the relationship. His idea of life is to go to the occasional audition, dodge his landlord (having spent the rent money Sally gave him), give Sally a hang-dog look, and talk with Pearce, who lives upstairs. Mark's flat is in disrepair: the kitchen window slams shut, bits of plaster fall from the ceiling, a bulb fizzes, and the sitting-room chandelier sways. When an awful accident happens, Mark freezes, which precipitates additional accidents; he finally calls Pearce, perhaps the worst decision possible. Will Mark come to his senses?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1139319, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 2936}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:14:22.937000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A broke, jobless actor and a broke, jobless screenwriter set out to make a movie and then find that life starts imitating art.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwNjgzNjM0MjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDMxMjY3MDMx._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1262304000000, "runtime": 89, "title": "A Film with Me in It", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1262908800000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1442430548000, "production": "Maximum Film Distribution", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 771, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.parallelfilms.com/default.asp"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Doherty"], "year": 2008}
