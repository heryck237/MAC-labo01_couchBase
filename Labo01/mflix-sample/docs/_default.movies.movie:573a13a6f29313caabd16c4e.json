The filmmakers expose this delightfully deranged cult by capturing the daily lives of its members. Interviews in movie houses, on the street and in the homes of the subjects tell the story of each individual. Many cannot hold a job, or choose not to. All of them have demoted the importance of the real world, giving all of their attention to the fantasy world of the movies. These human encyclopedias of cinema see two to five films a day, and from 600 to 2,000 films per year. Many have no physical sex lives, living instead in a world of romance with stars like James Dean or Audrey Hepburn. In Cinemania, Hollywood's biggest fans become the true stars. This is the story of their lives, their memories, their unbending habits and the films they love.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 281724, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1936}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-28 00:22:16.793000000", "metacritic": 67, "plot": "This documentary about the culture of intense cinephilia in New York City reveals the impassioned world of five obsessed movie buffs.
