Unable to escape Brixton, they are trapped together in Johnny's anything-but-safe safe house, sandwiched between a Rastafarian reggae pirate radio station upstairs and a West Indian 'Yardie' crack-dealing gangster, Julius, downstairs. As the charismatic Flynn finds common ground with the Yardies, Johnny fights to realize a peace process of his own, but makes the mistake of falling for Julius's girlfriend Rita, causing all-out war. A thriller in the vein of Lock Stock and The Long Good Friday, in which questions of race, morality, identity and loyalty play out against a great sound-track of reggae, rock, new wave and soul.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 426501, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 1501}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:37:34.037000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Johnny Doyle escapes a violent past in Ireland to lie low in London, until his former mentor Flynn breaks out of Brixton Prison, hell bent on derailing the Irish peace process with a few ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NjU4ODQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIwMzIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1153267200000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Johnny Was", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1164672000000, "lastUpdated": 1438541922000, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 90, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Brendan Foley"], "year": 2006}
