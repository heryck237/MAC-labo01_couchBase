We open with our heroine, Maeve, putting on her new snow white bra, and stepping out into the world as a young woman. She has an obsession with breasts and bras and can't help but stare at other girls and women, even the head nun doesn't escape her gaze. Otherwise, her world revolves around her three friends, Ruth, Claire and Orla, who are more experienced in the ways of the world. They wear bras already (except Claire the feminist) and they've all had boyfriends. The new bra is a start but they really hope Maeve can find a fella, even offering kissing lessons to prepare her. What no one expects, least of all Maeve, is that she should snare the local sixteen-year old heartthrob. Maeve is so smitten with him that she lets her friends down when they need her the most. In trouble with her friends and in school, she gets dumped by the heartthrob when she sneaks into the local dance with him and he leaves with another girl. Her parents find out and she ends up in trouble at home, where she takes on extra domestic duties. She does the laundry and even her bra has lost its former brilliance. Maeve realizes what she has lost. Her friends rally round for her 14th birthday, Maeve returns to the fold a little older and a little wiser.
