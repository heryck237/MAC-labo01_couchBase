It's a good place for him. A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he's the life of the party, loves his job at a men's clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he's never far from his supersized, whiskey-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finecky hovering over him. She's different: the \"nice girl\" who reads science fiction and doesn't have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they're drawn together.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1714206, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 87796}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:16:28.647000000", "metacritic": 82, "plot": "A hard-partying high school senior's philosophy on life changes when he meets the not-so-typical \"nice girl.\"", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTc0NTkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwNjE3OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1379030400000, "runtime": 95, "title": "The Spectacular Now", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.9M", "consensus": "The Spectacular Now is an adroit, sensitive film that avoids typical coming-of-age story trappings.", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 148, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1389657600000, "fresh": 137, "lastUpdated": 1440266518000, "production": "A24", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 35657, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://spectacularnowmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Scott Neustadter (screenplay)", "Michael H.
