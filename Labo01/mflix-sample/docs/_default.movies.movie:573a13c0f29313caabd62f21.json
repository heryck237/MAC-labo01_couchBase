In 2007, the government proposed a piece of moderate legislation, \"diritti di coppie conviventi\" (rights for cohabiting couples) or DICOs; it's quickly clear they face tough sledding in the Senate. Luca Ragazzi and Gustav Hofer, a couple for eight years, with camera in hand, follow the Senate proceedings weekly, seek interviews with politicians, attend anti-DICO rallies, and ask questions of persons in the street. The focus includes the meaning of family and Italy's implicit union of church and state.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1185600, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 172}, "languages": ["Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-27 00:02:01.420000000", "plot": "A couple engage in discussions with people on the street, politicians and religious leaders about the discrimination against gays and lesbians in Italy.", "released": 1212278400000, "runtime": 85, "title": "Suddenly, Last Winter", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437071605000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 87, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gustav Hofer", "Luca Ragazzi"], "year": 2008}
