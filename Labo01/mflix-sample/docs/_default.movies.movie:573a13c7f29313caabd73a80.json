At first, it's an outbreak of loss of smell. It's often presaged by a destructive temper tantrum. In this mix are a scientist and a chef - she's Susan, one of a team trying to understand the epidemic; he's Michael, charming and engaging. Susan and Michael begin a relationship in the middle of increasing chaos, as the loss of other senses plagues more people and as civil authorities try to maintain order. Susan's voice-over reflections provide insight. Is love possible in such a changed world? Can anything make perfect sense?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 1439572, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 37018}, "languages": ["English", "Sign Languages"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:14:03.203000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "A chef and a scientist fall in love as an epidemic begins to rob people of their sensory perceptions.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjYwMjkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE1NjIxNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1317945600000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Perfect Sense", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.6k", "critic": {"meter": 52, "numReviews": 52, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 1337644800000, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1442077983000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 25, "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 5540, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/PerfectSenseFilm"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kim Fupz Aakeson"], "year": 2011}
