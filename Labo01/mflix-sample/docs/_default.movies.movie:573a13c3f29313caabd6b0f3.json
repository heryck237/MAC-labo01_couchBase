In a bar, a cigar-smoking swell reads the financial section of a newspaper. The vagabond enters, the upstanding man ignores a request for alms, the hobo exits. The gent can't find his wallet, so he orders espresso after espresso as he ponders what to do. The vagabond returns, a napping nun at the next table gives him money, and the gent considers pilfering her purse. As the evening drags on, the bill for espresso mounts.
