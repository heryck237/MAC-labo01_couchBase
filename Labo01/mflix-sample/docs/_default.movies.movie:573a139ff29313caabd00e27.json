Jip calls himself a sexual paranoid, afraid he's impotent. Lulu, Jip's mate, doesn't find much to fancy in men. Nina hates her job at a fast food joint, and her man, Koop, who dreams of being a great hip-hop d.j., is prone to fits of un-provoked jealousy. The fifth is Moff, whose family is down on his behavior. Starting Friday afternoon, with preparations for clubbing, we follow the five from Ecstacy-induced fun through a booze-laden come-down early Saturday morning followed by the weekend's aftermath. It's breakthrough time for at least three of them.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 188674, "rating": 7, "votes": 18026}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:05:44.087000000", "metacritic": 53, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Five friends spend one lost weekend in a mix of music, love and club culture.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZlMjIxZjgtZGJiMC00ODAwLWJhNWYtYWJkZDg2Y2VkM2QyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 957484800000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Human Traffic", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 29, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 976579200000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1441134547000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 12, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 33058, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Justin Kerrigan"], "year": 1999}
