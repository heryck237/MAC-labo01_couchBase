Premiered in America the film is pilloried by ultra-right religious groups for its depiction of Christ. In England the Popular Peoples' Church of St Sophia (whose members include a Tourette's sufferer who shouts out swear words) find a copy of the script in a dustbin and lobby the British censor for its suppression, leading to many local councils banning its screening. Death threats follow and Michael Palin - \"the nicest man in Britain\" - has his effigy burned on his front lawn. Finally crazed TV programmer Alan Dick persuades Palin and co-star John Cleese to defend the picture on a late night chat show against the Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. Thanks to Cleese's reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph, winning over the Popular Peoples' Church. A later encounter with God will show how the film's controversy paved the way for other artistic endeavours which prompted protest. Brilliant characterisations are vitiated by a satirical 'treatment' including animated sequences and irritating attempts at surreal wit when a documentary style treatment would have sufficed. Several of the Pythons were hostile to the film, summed up in the floor manager's comment. \"Another fantasy sequence...lame\".", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1981637, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1186}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 01:21:28.997000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Tells the story of the outraged, and sometimes violent, response to 'The Life of Brian' the Monty Python movie that satirized the life of Jesus.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU5NzYyMTAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk5NTA2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1318982400000, "runtime": 89, "title": "Holy Flying Circus", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1414541016000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 1, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tony Roche"], "year": 2011}
