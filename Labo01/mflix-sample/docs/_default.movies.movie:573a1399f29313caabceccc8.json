Fewer than 70 days later, Vincent dies from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We see Vincent at work, painting landscapes and portraits. His brother Theo, wife Johanna, and their baby visit Auvers. Vincent is playful and charming, engaging the attentions of Gachet's daughter Marguerite (who's half Vincent's age), a young maid at the inn, Cathy a Parisian prostitute, and Johanna. Shortly before his death, Vincent visits Paris, quarrels with Theo, disparages his own art and accomplishments, dances at a brothel, and is warm then cold toward Marguerite.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 103190, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1709}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:10:31.923000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The final sixty-seven days of Van Gogh's life is examined.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MzcwNjYxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY5NzAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 720403200000, "runtime": 158, "title": "Van Gogh", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1168300800000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1430681412000, "production": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 629, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Maurice Pialat"], "year": 1991}
