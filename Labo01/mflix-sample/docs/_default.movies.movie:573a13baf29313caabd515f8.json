Spirited and adored by the public at large she quickly found her marriage to be a disappointment, defined by her duty to produce a male heir and the Duke's philandering and callous indifference to her. She befriends Lady Bess but finds she is once again betrayed by her husband who wields his power with the three eventually living uncomfortably together. Against this background, and with the pressures of an unfaithful husband, strict social pressures and constant public scrutiny, Georgiana falls passionately in love with Charles Grey, a rising young Whig politician. However, despite his ongoing liaison with Lady Bess, the Duke refuses to allow her to continue the affair and threatens to take her children from her.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 864761, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 56215}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:19:48.887000000", "metacritic": 62, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A chronicle of the life of 18th century aristocrat Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was reviled for her extravagant political and personal life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTQzMjgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQxMzk3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1223596800000, "runtime": 110, "title": "The Duchess", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$13.8M", "consensus": "While The Duchess treads the now-familiar terrain of the corset-ripper, the costumes look great and Keira Knightley's performance is stellar in this subtly feminist, period drama.", "critic": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 162, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1233014400000, "fresh": 99, "lastUpdated": 1442080356000, "production": "Paramount Vantage", "rotten": 63, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 68463, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.theduchessmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeffrey Hatcher (screenplay)", "Anders Thomas Jensen (screenplay)", "Saul Dibb (screenplay)", "Amanda Foreman (book)"], "year": 2008}
