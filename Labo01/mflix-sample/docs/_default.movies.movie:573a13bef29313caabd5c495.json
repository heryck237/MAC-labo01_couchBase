Angered that his daughter, Mary, is dating a Caucasian male, Dave, he counsels her to stop seeing him as it is forbidden for women to marry outside Islam. But when Mary persists, he relents and permits her to marry, provided she travels with him to Lahore, Pakistan, to meet his estranged mother and brother, to which she agrees. Once there, Mary is then taken to a remote area in Afghanistan and forced to marry her cousin, Sarmad Khan, a singing artiste, who has turned conservative after being influenced by Moulana Tahiri. Sarmad's brother, Mansoor, re-locates to Chicago, to enroll for music lessons with Professor Lincoln, meets with Caucasian fellow-student, Janie, and both fall in love with each other. Than the events of 9-11 will result in Mansoor's arrest by the CIA. He is isolated, humiliated, fed pork, tortured endlessly until he reveals his role within Al Qaeda and his association with Usama Bin Laden. He is then lodged in a stinking cell where he proceeds to write 'I LOVE USA' on the walls. Mary in the meantime, with the assistance of other oppressed women, manages to escape, but is captured, taken back, sexually molested by Sarmad, becomes pregnant and gives birth to a girl. While back in the USA, the torture takes a heavy toll on Mansoor, he then changes the writings on the wall to 'I LOVE USAMA', while investigators come across Arabic evidence that he may have been actually involved in the 9-11 attacks.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1068956, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 7179}, "languages": ["Urdu", "English", "Panjabi", "Arabic", "Pushto"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 01:01:59.410000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two brothers, both artistes, experience major changes at the hands of Islamic fundamentalists and the U.S. Government; while their female cousin is abducted, forced to marry, and sexually molested.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODY4NTEzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQzNTI1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1184889600000, "runtime": 168, "title": "In the Name of God", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1211846400000, "lastUpdated": 1442080767000, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 4357, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Shoaib Mansoor", "Faiza Mujahid (lyrics)", "Bulleh Shah (lyrics)"], "year": 2007}
