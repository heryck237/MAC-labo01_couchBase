One of the camp directors, Jaroslaw, is a young professor who prefers the straightforward, intimate approach to students. He is opposed in his liberal views by Jakub, who likes to manipulate people. There is a confrontation from the beginning when Jaroslaw allows to attend the seminar a student who presents the views not according to the official line. In the end, a jury prize is given to mediocre paper, while the suspected school of thought still draws a recommendation. Finally the deputy rector arrives for the closing ceremonies, and since he disfavors the line of thought awarded by the recommendation the tensions rise. They climax when student in question bites the rector in the ear while receiving recommendation. The confrontation results in a scandal and the police is called in.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 75730, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 538}, "languages": ["Polish", "English", "German", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:37:45.407000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A group of students are spending the summer vacation at a university camp studying the science of linguistics.
