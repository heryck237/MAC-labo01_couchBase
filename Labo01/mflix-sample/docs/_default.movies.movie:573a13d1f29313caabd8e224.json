Thus she becomes burdened with a secret she cannot reveal to anyone, even to her relatives. Joanna knows that she cannot keep Rose with her as she is already under observation, but she fails to find a hiding spot for Rose and is forced to become the lover of a German officer in return for protection. Forced by necessity, she has to cooperate with her enemies, becoming a traitor in the eyes of \"her people\". The final, symbolic image is suggestive - in a tearful and religious manner - of the fact that sheltering little Roza was Joanna's personal torture referring to Golgotha. However, the deeper meaning of that story is perverse and bitter: hiding the child was even more dangerous because of Joanna's \"own people\", mutually controlling the patriotic decency.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 1799110, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 310}, "languages": ["Polish", "French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:17:07.270000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "During the Occupation, a young woman whose husband disappeared during the war decides to hide a little Jewish girl.
