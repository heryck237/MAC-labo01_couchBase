While camping in Ukiah, Nick meets Sheeni: for him, it's love at first sight. Nick has to figure out how to get his father a job in Ukiah, then how to get sent to live with his father, then how to get close to Sheeni, whose religious parents may want her sent away from temptation to a boarding school. There's also Sheeni's all-American boyfriend to contend with. Overwhelmed by the challenges, Nick's about to give up when he conjures an alter ego who whispers revolt into his ear. Nick is not altogether hapless, but can this end well?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 403702, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 61424}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:42:39.680000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "While his trailer trash parents teeter on the edge of divorce, Nick Twisp sets his sights on dream girl Sheeni Saunders, hoping that she'll be the one to take away his virginity.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3NTkxODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE4NjI5Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1262908800000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Youth in Revolt", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$15.2M", "consensus": "It may not entirely do its source material justice, but Miguel Arteta's Youth in Revolt is a fun, funny comic romp that lets Michael Cera stretch a little and introduces filmgoers to a major find in Portia Doubleday.", "critic": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 163, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1276560000000, "fresh": 107, "lastUpdated": 1442337819000, "production": "The Weinstein Company", "rotten": 56, "viewer": {"meter": 52, "numReviews": 114311, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://youthinrevolt-themovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gustin Nash (screenplay)", "C.D.
