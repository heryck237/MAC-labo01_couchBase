Agent Connie Clausen enables him to be a 'resident alien', writing film reviews and dispensing words of wisdom. Curious about but impervious to trends, he describes AIDS as a \"fad, nothing more\", actually to divert heterosexual anger but he is misinterpreted and reviled by many gays. A return to popularity occurs when he helps Patrick Angus, a young, AIDS-afflicted artist attain fame for his paintings and his healthy cynicism is marketed by performance artist Penny Arcade, putting him back in the limelight. Poor health causes him to refuse a lecture tour of England but he gives a triumphant final audience at a gay club in Tampa. A postscript informs that he died at the age of 91.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 997057, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1050}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:39:00.213000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The later years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNTUyNjAyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYyMzEwMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1240790400000, "runtime": 75, "title": "An Englishman in New York", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1266883200000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1440269631000, "production": "Breaking Glass Pictures", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 320, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Brian Fillis"], "year": 2009}
