To save Ben from domestication, Andrew invites Ben to a party at a sex-positive commune. Everyone there plans on making erotic art films for the local amateur porn festival and Andrew wants in. They run out of booze and ideas, save for one: Andrew should have sex with Ben, on camera. It's not gay; it's beyond gay. It's not porn; it's an art project. The next day, they find themselves unable to back down from the dare. And there's nothing standing in their way - except Ben's wife Anna, heterosexuality, and certain mechanical questions.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1334537, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 4610}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:24:36.063000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "Two guys take their bromance to another level when they participate in an art film project.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNTYyODA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2MDE1Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1253059200000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Humpday", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.3M", "consensus": "Observant and insightful, this indie comedy takes a different tack on the \"bromance\" but still makes a point without sermonizing.", "critic": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 131, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1258416000000, "fresh": 104, "lastUpdated": 1441136655000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 27, "viewer": {"meter": 51, "numReviews": 18661, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://www.humpdayishere.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Lynn Shelton"], "year": 2009}
