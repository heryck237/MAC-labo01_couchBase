Groups prepare coronations, parades, balls, and revelry. White and Black communities have separate royal courts and separate events. People comment on these vestiges of segregation, some critical and some okay with it. The Black king and queen come to the coronation of the White royal couple, and the White king and queen join the celebration at the Comrades party, a primarily Black event. City patriarchs agree to do more together, and the city's youth seem to want more interaction as well. The film explores possible contradictions between preserving traditions and putting the old Mobile behind them.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1157694, "rating": 7, "votes": 321}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:07:52.410000000", "metacritic": 79, "plot": "In 2007 Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras is celebrated... and complicated.
