A few days later their residence is broken into, however, nothing appears to be missing. In order to prevent re-occurrences, they install a number of security cameras that will record everything on a DVR. After they hire a Spanish-speaking nanny to look after Hunter, she informs them that there is something wrong in their house and performs prayers, much to the chagrin of Daniel, who lets her go. He will subsequently regret this decision as more inexplicable and strange incidents occur, with Ali concluding, after a research, that their house may be possessed by a demonic entity.", "genres": ["Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 1536044, "rating": 5.7, "votes": 75700}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:03:15.613000000", "metacritic": 53, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "After experiencing what they think are a series of \"break-ins\", a family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDgwMzAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3OTk4Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1287705600000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Paranormal Activity 2", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$84.7M", "consensus": "Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't cover any new ground, but its premise is still scary -- and in some respects, it's a better film than the original.", "critic": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 131, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1297123200000, "fresh": 76, "lastUpdated": 1441993535000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 55, "viewer": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 102339, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.paranormalmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Michael R.
