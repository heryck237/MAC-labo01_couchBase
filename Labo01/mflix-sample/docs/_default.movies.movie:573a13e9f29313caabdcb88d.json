He needs the cash to free Leonidas from prison because the latter once saved his life when he was behind bars. For Stratos, this is simply a question of honour. We've no idea how many people he's already killed, but we do notice that he still has a conscience. He attentively looks after a neighbour's child, eight-year-old Katharina, as well as her mother and an uncle. At last he has enough money for the prison break-out. But Leonidas is lured into a bloody trap, by his brother of all people, who disappears with the money.

He must act, even if this means following one wrongdoing with another.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 3259474, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 682}, "languages": ["Greek"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:15:54.890000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "By night, Stratos works in a bread factory but by day, he's a professional hit man.
