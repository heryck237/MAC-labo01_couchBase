His son Vince, an electrician, overhears a man talking about making a fortune in just a day. When the man overdoses on drugs, Vince finds instructions and a cell phone that the man has received and substitutes himself: taking a train to New York and awaiting contact. He has no idea what it's about. He ends up at a remote house where wealthy men bet on who will survive a complicated game of Russian roulette: he's number 13. In flashbacks we meet other contestants, including a man whose brother takes him out of a mental institution in order to compete. Can Vince be the last one standing?", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 798817, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 32620}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:11:31.280000000", "metacritic": 29, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself embroiled in an underground world of power, violence, and chance where men gamble behind closed doors on the lives of other men.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YWZjYWItY2U0NS00N2ZlLWFkOGEtY2M2N2E0NDA5MjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1267401600000, "runtime": 91, "title": 13, "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 8, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 3.8}, "dvd": 1320710400000, "fresh": 1, "lastUpdated": 1442164525000, "production": "Anchor Bay", "rotten": 12, "viewer": {"meter": 34, "numReviews": 5533, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://www.13-film.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["G\u00e8la Babluani (screenplay)", "Greg Pruss (screenplay)", "G\u00e8la Babluani (screenplay)"], "year": 2010}
