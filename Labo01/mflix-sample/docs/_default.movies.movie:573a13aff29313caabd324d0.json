Antoine arranges a job in Tangiers so he can reconnect to C\u00e8cile, his first love, unseen for 30 years. Sami, her son, comes from Paris with his friend Nadia and her son to see his mother and his Moroccan boyfriend. Nadia wants to see A\u00e8cha, her twin, a devout Muslim unwilling to see her pill-popping sister.

C\u00e8cile is a follower. Dogs and mud present dangers, as does complaisance.
