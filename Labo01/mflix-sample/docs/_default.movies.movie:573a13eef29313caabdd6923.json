Martin is clearly out of place both in his office, and at home with his wife and son. As he embarks on a trek searching for solace in the stunning Norwegian wilderness, he can't seem to find peace: his incessant stream of thoughts are endlessly commenting and fantasising about disturbing what ifs: what if he got a divorce? What if his wife died? What if he were a cripple? As the day stretches on, Martin prepares for a drastic change of pace amidst the wildlife in what is both a considered and consistently humorous portrayal of how easy it is to feel alienated in a very stable life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 3596492, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 397}, "languages": ["Norwegian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-09 00:38:54.257000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A journey inside Martin's head.
