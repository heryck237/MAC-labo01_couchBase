Their only discontent is Noriko's lack of a husband. Society is changing: she works, she has women friends who tease and argue, her brother sees her independence as impudence, she sees it as normal. When her boss suggests that she marry a 40-year-old bachelor who is his friend, all the members of her family press her to accept. Without seeking their advice, and to their chagrin, Noriko determines her own course of action.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 43313, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 4082}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:32:42.677000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A family chooses a match for their daughter Noriko, but she, surprisingly, has her own plans.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGE1N2Y4ZmItMWU1Ny00OTg2LTkxNWYtMTg1Y2U0N2ViMzg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 81561600000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Early Summer", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 9, "rating": 8.8}, "dvd": 1090281600000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1441220298000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 2859, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["K\u00e8go Noda", "Yasujir\u00e8 Ozu"], "year": 1951}
