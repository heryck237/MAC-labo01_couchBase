If the King dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The Pope and most of Europe oppose him. Into this impass steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer, and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 3556920, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 3156}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 01:36:20.977000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "After the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey, his secretary, Thomas Cromwell, finds himself amongst the treachery and intrigue of King Henry VIII's court and soon becomes a close advisor to the King, a role fraught with danger.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNTc4ODIzMTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI0OTA5Njcx._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1428192000000, "title": "Wolf Hall", "type": "movie", "year": 2015}
