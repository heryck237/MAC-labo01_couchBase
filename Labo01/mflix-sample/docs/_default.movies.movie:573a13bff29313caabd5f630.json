She explores her memory using photographs, film clips, home movies, contemporary interviews, and set pieces she designs to capture a feeling, a time, or a frame. Shining through each scene are her impish charm, inventiveness, and natural empathy. How do people grow old, how does loss stay with them, can they remain creative, and what do they remember? Memory, she says, is like a swarm of confused flies. She envisions hers for us.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 1129435, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1570}, "languages": ["French", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:12:21.753000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Agn\u00e8s Varda explores her memories, mostly chronologically, with photographs, film clips, interviews, reenactments, and droll, playful contemporary scenes of her narrating her story.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwOTMwNjM1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ0OTk2Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1229472000000, "runtime": 110, "title": "The Beaches of Agn\u00e8s", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "An enchanting self-portrait by a veteran director, Beach of Agnes is equal parts playful and profound.", "critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 66, "rating": 8.2}, "dvd": 1266796800000, "fresh": 63, "lastUpdated": 1440615230000, "production": "Cinema Guild", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 1154, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Agn\u00e8s Varda"], "year": 2008}
