The story is mostly Yong Nan's, told in flashbacks: how he came to the monastery, his brief return to the city, his vacillation between the turbulence of the world and his hope to overcome passions and escape the idea of self. We also see Hyegok as a teacher, a protector, and a father figure, and we watch Haejin make his way as a curious and nearly self-sufficient child.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 97195, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 900}, "languages": ["Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-04-04 01:22:06.903000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Three people live in a remote Buddhist monastery near Mount Chonan: Hyegok, the old master; Yong Nan, a young man who has left his extended family in the city to seek enlightenment - Hyegok...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzIwNzU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5NzcxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 622512000000, "runtime": 137, "title": "Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?: A Zen Fable", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 6, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1192492800000, "fresh": 6, "lastUpdated": 1440614250000, "production": "Bae Yong-Kyun Productions", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 784, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Yong-Kyun Bae"], "year": 1989}
