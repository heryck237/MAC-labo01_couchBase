By morning, the earrings have been returned, Valerie's first period has begun, and a troupe and a missionary have arrived in her Medieval town. The thief is Orick; he reports to a cloaked constable who may also be the missionary. Attention to sexuality is everywhere: Valerie's grandmother's puritanical nature, the missionary's sermon to the town's virgins, the parish priest's attempt to seduce Valerie, and lusty adults at play. Valerie's nascent sexuality puts her in great danger. Can she navigate the passage from innocence to experience, a route teaming with vampires, a murderer, and an obscure family tree?", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 66516, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 4022}, "languages": ["Czech"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:17:13.837000000", "plot": "Inspired by fairy-tales such as Alice in Wonderland and Little Red-Riding Hood, \"Valerie and her Week of Wonders\" is a surreal tale in which love, fear, sex and religion merge into one fantastic world.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWNlNjdhMzEtOTIxYi00NDQ1LWI5OTUtNTE3MmU1OWUwMTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MTUwNTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 24883200000, "runtime": 73, "title": "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 12, "rating": 8.2}, "dvd": 1073952000000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1441304920000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 2108, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["V\u00e8tezslav Nezval (novel)", "Jaromil Jires (screenplay)", "Ester Krumbachov\u00e8 (screenplay)", "Jir\u00e8 Musil (dialogue)"], "year": 1970}
