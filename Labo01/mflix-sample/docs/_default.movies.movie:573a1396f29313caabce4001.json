Christine hopes to start a family with Eddie immediately. But Christine finds that she is restless in her life with Eddie and moves on. From move to move which are always done on a whim, Christine has a similar restless attitude, always dreaming of something better. But she has no real marketable job skills - although she is always thinking about continuing with her schooling in some trade to make a better life for herself - or sense of what working in a traditional type job means. She is able to get by on her looks, which lands her a job as a Las Vegas showgirl. She also goes in and out of relationships - including with Vegas comic Danny Raymond, ex-football player Tommy Marcott who too is trying to find his meaningful niche in life, older businessman Richard Morgan who acts as her sugar daddy, and rock musician Jay Rigney - always dreaming of the perfect relationship situation which never seems to materialize. As such, her life goes into a tailspin. She ultimately lets the world know how she feels life has treated her.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 65795, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 272}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 00:13:08.070000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Wide-eyed nineteen year old Christine Adams decides on a whim to leave her broken family life in small town British Columbia to move to Los Angeles to be with her boyfriend Eddie Molina, ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY0MTIxNTQtZGVmYi00N2MwLWE1MDktMDM0OTE1MDk1YmFhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 34387200000, "runtime": 98, "title": "The Grasshopper", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1441135845000, "viewer": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 30, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark McShane (novel)", "Jerry Belson (story)", "Garry Marshall (story)", "Jerry Belson (screenplay)", "Garry Marshall (screenplay)"], "year": 1970}
