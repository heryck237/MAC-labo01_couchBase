There's a searing pain in his gut that he can't tolerate and a dazed quietness to his struggle as he tries to maintain his equilibrium. Wilson is attempting to move on from the sudden and inexplicable suicide of his wife. His mother-in-law is there for him, but her sympathies turn quickly. He has an employer that seems to want to help him, and a workmate who wants him for herself. But nothing and no one can give Wilson solace; so, he seeks oblivion. It is not the usual alcohol or drugs. Wilson inhales fumes from gasoline cans and model airplane fuel and finds temporary salvation in the company of remote-control model enthusiasts. However, nothing that provides him relief really lasts.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 282698, "rating": 7, "votes": 6082}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:17:26.360000000", "metacritic": 58, "plot": "Following the unexplained suicide of his wife Liza, a web designer turns to gasoline fumes and remote-control airplanes while avoiding an inevitable conflict with his mother-in-law.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NTYxNTEzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY3MTg5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1043971200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Love Liza", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Hoffman's performance is strong, but the lack of character development and story arc makes Love Liza unsatisfying.", "critic": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 85, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1053993600000, "fresh": 45, "lastUpdated": 1440443105000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 40, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 7081, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.lovelizathemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gordy Hoffman (screenplay)"], "year": 2002}
