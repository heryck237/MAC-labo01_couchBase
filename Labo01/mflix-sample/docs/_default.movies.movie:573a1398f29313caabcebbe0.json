That destiny may change with the fortunes of what she sees as the next symbol of their relationship, a somewhat sickly elder tree Louis plants in their garden for their one year anniversary. Their relationship is placed under a strain with the arrival of Kay's formerly institutionalized sister Dawn - nicknamed Sweetie - and Sweetie's current boyfriend, Bob, who Sweetie believes will help her get into show business. Kay's pleas to her father Gordon to help get Sweetie out of her house go largely ignored, as he has never judged Sweetie, who he still sees as his performing loving little girl. Gordon is facing his own issues as Kay and Sweetie's mother, Flo, has just left him on a trial separation, their issues largely stemming from his protecting Sweetie at all cost, Sweetie who had most recently been living with them.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 98725, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 2308}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 11:49:51.237000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Based solely on a tea leaf reading, superstitious and introspective Kay believes she and Louis are destined to fall in love with each other, he who she is able to convince of the same ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M0ZGIxYzgtYmU1ZS00YzIxLWIyNTgtODU1NGVmNThkNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 622944000000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Sweetie", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1161648000000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1439145035000, "production": "Avenue Pictures Productions", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 1500, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gerard Lee (screenplay)", "Jane Campion (screenplay)", "Jane Campion (original story idea)"], "year": 1989}
