Following his father's suicide, haunted by his inner daemons and hatred for the world in general, Santiago decides to escape the crude Lima winter to take refuge in Mancora, a beach to the north of Peru where it is always summer. Upon his departure, Santiago receives the unexpected visit from his stepsister, Ximena, a young and beautiful photographer in her late twenties, accompanied by her husband Inigo, a young surgeon from Spain. The three take off on a journey escaping reality and in search of themselves. Santiago and Ximena find refuge in each other, which sparks off jealousies within Inigo, and a trip that was intended to be a simple escape turns out to be much more, when each of the three crosses limits and borders they should never have crossed. The three are placed face to face with their dreams and daemons. \"Mancora\" is a story of redemption, where a kid becomes a man and learns to forgive the world.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1003023, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 991}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:21:26.493000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "An adventure drama that tells the story of Santiago, a 22-year old from Lima.
