Timothy, prone to escaping his dismal high school reality through dazzling musical daydreams, gets to answer that question in a very real way. After his eccentric teacher casts him as Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream, he stumbles upon a recipe hidden within the script to create the play's magical, purple love-pansy. Armed with the pansy, Timothy's fading spirit soars as he puckishly imposes a new reality by turning much of his narrow-minded town gay, beginning with the rugby-jock of his dreams. Ensnaring family, friends and enemies in this chaos, Timothy forces them to walk a mile in his musical shoes. The course of true love never did run smooth; it's a bumpy ride.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 476991, "rating": 7, "votes": 3969}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:21:33.643000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A bullied and demoralized gay student at an all-boys school uses a magical flower derived from Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream' to turn many in his community gay, including a comely rugby player for himself.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwMzkyOTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2Mjg5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1242259200000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Were the World Mine", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1244505600000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1440181203000, "production": "Wolfe Releasing", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 2911, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.weretheworldminefilm.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cory Krueckeberg", "Tom Gustafson", "William Shakespeare (inspired by the play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\")"], "year": 2008}
