In the days leading up to July 4, 1776, Continental Congressmen John Adams and Benjamin Franklin coerce Thomas Jefferson into writing the Declaration of Independence as a delaying tactic as they try to persuade the American colonies to support a resolution on independence. As George Washington sends depressing messages describing one military disaster after another, the businessmen, landowners and slave holders in Congress all stand in the way of the Declaration, and a single \"nay\" vote will forever end the question of independence. Large portions of spoken and sung dialog are taken directly from the letters and memoirs of the actual participants.", "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 68156, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 6067}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:04:07.447000000", "plot": "A musical retelling of the American Revolution's political struggle in the Continental Congress to declare independence.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZhYWMxMDMtODU2Yi00MDVmLWI4ODYtMzgyNjg4NGNjZjM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 90806400000, "runtime": 141, "title": 1776, "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1025568000000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1441045405000, "production": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 8378, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sherman Edwards (play)", "Peter Stone (play)", "Peter Stone (screenplay)"], "year": 1972}
