For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts. He's probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can't reconcile opposing values. A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 70379, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 63075}, "languages": ["English", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 04:48:39.913000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A small-time hood struggles to succeed on the \"mean streets\" of Little Italy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWNmNGY3ZGMtYWQ3OC00Zjg4LWFiN2EtZjM2MDI1YzRiNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 119404800000, "runtime": 112, "title": "Mean Streets", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Mean Streets is a powerful tale of urban sin and guilt that marks Scorsese's arrival as an important cinematic voice and features electrifying performances from Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 50, "rating": 8.9}, "dvd": 1092700800000, "fresh": 49, "lastUpdated": 1442138010000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 53390, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Martin Scorsese (screenplay)", "Mardik Martin (screenplay)", "Martin Scorsese (story)"], "year": 1973}
