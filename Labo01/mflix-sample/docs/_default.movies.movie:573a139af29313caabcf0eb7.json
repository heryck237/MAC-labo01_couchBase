She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 120686, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 42504}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:28:20.233000000", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A terminally ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her former husband's life who will be their stepmother.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJlOWM3ODctZjY3NC00YmRjLTg0NjgtNTFhOWQ4YzI4YjU3L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 914544000000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Stepmom", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Great performances from the leads can't save this factory mill tearjerker.", "critic": {"meter": 44, "numReviews": 55, "rating": 5.1}, "dvd": 946684800000, "fresh": 24, "lastUpdated": 1439926234000, "production": "TriStar Pictures", "rotten": 31, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 271620, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/stepmom/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gigi Levangie (story)", "Gigi Levangie (screenplay)", "Jessie Nelson (screenplay)", "Steven Rogers (screenplay)", "Karen Leigh Hopkins (screenplay)", "Ronald Bass (screenplay)"], "year": 1998}
