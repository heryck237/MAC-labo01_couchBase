He proclaims himself as semi-Robin Hood, who steals from the rich but does not give it to the poor. His life revolves around robbery and frequent visits to jail. Hired by a robbers' duo, the Johari brothers (Rajiv and Raghu), he plans to rob a train full of treasures, thus making it the greatest phenomenon in his life. On his way, he encounters an Oscar-obsessed film star (Akshaye Khanna), a seductive-and-desiring-to-be-a-superstar-some-day girlfriend (Katrina Kaif) and to accompany him in this heist, an entire village.
