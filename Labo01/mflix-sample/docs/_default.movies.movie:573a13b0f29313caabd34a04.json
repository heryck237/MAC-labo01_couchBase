He's clear about the arrangement: he trades his time for money - cashback, as he calls it. We meet his co-workers, Sharon, Barry, and Matt, and their supervisor, Jenkins. Ben's colleagues are good at wasting time, but Ben talks to us about how he makes his shift go faster: by imagining that time has stopped. We see this late-night world of drudgery through Ben's eyes, as time does indeed stop, and he can get out his sketch book.", "genres": ["Short", "Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 409799, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 7252}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:20:38.297000000", "plot": "Ben is an art college student in London, whose imagination runs wild as he works the late-night shift at the local supermarket.
