That spring, led by Nate Ruffin, a player who was ill and missed the fatal flight, students rally to convince the board of governors to play the 1971 season. The college president, Don Dedman, must find a coach, who then must find players. They petition the NCAA to allow freshmen to play, and coach Jack Lengyel motivates and leads young players at the same time that he reexamines the Lombardi creed that winning is the only thing. The father and the fianc\u00e8e of a player who died find strength to move on. Can Marshall win even one game in 1971?", "genres": ["Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 758794, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 43253}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 03:33:56.457000000", "metacritic": 53, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "When a plane crash claims the lives of members of the Marshall University football team and some of its fans, the team's new coach and his surviving players try to keep the football program alive.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNDczNTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwMzEzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1166745600000, "runtime": 131, "title": "We Are Marshall", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$43.5M", "consensus": "Matthew McConaughey almost runs We Are Marshall to the end zone, but can't stop it from taking the easy, feel-good route in memorializing this historic event in American sports.", "critic": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 124, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1190073600000, "fresh": 61, "lastUpdated": 1442256260000, "production": "Warner Bros.
