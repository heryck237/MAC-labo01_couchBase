El Topo (the mole) claims to be God, while dressed as a gunfighter in black, riding a horse through a spiritual, mystical landscape strewn with old Western movie, and ancient Eastern religious symbols. Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his. El Topo's surreal way is bloody, sexual and self-reflective, musing of his own demons, as he tries to vanquish those he encounters.", "genres": ["Western"], "imdb": {"id": 67866, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 16467}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:41:48.470000000", "plot": "A mysterious black-clad gunfighter wanders a mystical Western landscape encountering multiple bizarre characters.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUzMWQzMTItYzZiOS00NmI1LWIzMTgtOWE4NzE1M2NhY2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 40521600000, "runtime": 125, "title": "El Topo", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 39, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1165968000000, "fresh": 30, "lastUpdated": 1442163722000, "production": "Tartan Films", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 14262, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Alejandro Jodorowsky"], "year": 1970}
