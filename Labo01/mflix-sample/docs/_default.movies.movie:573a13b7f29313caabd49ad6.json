The cousin of the director drives him to Archie's Ranch Market, in Carson, and drops him off to do a little research. He's fascinated by one of the checkers, Scarlet, a young woman from Spain with a preternatural ability to ring up items at the cash register. She hates her job, stuck at the 10 items or less lane. The actor chats her up, and when her shift ends, he asks for a ride. In the course of the afternoon, he helps her prepare for a job interview. She needs to have confidence, he needs to commit. Human contact, however brief, can change people.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 499603, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 12290}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:41:55.757000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An actor (Freeman) prepping for an upcoming role meets a quirky grocery clerk (Vega), and the pair hit the road to show one another their respective worlds.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTU4NjYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg1NzQ0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1170892800000, "runtime": 82, "title": "10 Items or Less", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$69.3k", "consensus": "A small film that relies too heavily on the charm of its big actors.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1177632000000, "fresh": 37, "lastUpdated": 1441905837000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 23811, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Brad Silberling"], "year": 2006}
