Naim is 20. She's Israeli. He's Palestinian. She lives in Jerusalem. He lives in Gaza. They were born in a land of scorched earth, where fathers bury their children. They must endure an explosive situation that is not of their choosing at an age where young people are falling in love and taking their place in adult life. A bottle thrown in the sea and a correspondence by email nurture the slender hope that their relationship might give them the strength to confront this harsh reality to grapple with it, and thereby ever so slightly change it. Only 60 miles separate them but how many bombings, check-points, sleepless nights and bloodstained days stand between them?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2082496, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 725}, "languages": ["Hebrew", "Arabic", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:47:50.523000000", "metacritic": 58, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Tal is 17 years old.
