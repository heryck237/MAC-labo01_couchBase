The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 223897, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 90165}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:46:21.253000000", "metacritic": 40, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young boy attempts to make the world a better place after his teacher gives him that chance.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI3ODI5NDEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYyMjU3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 972000000000, "runtime": 123, "title": "Pay It Forward", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$32.8M", "consensus": "Pay It Forward has strong performances from Spacey, Hunt, and Osment, but the movie itself is too emotionally manipulative and the ending is bad.", "critic": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 128, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 989884800000, "fresh": 51, "lastUpdated": 1440007257000, "production": "Warner Bros.
