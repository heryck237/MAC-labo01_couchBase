Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work and start over. He answers a classified ad entitled \"Departures\" thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a \"Nokanshi\" or \"encoffineer,\" a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life. While his wife and others despise the job, Daigo takes a certain pride in his work and begins to perfect the art of \"Nokanshi,\" acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life and death, between the departed and the family of the departed.
