But back then she played the role of Sigrid, an alluring young girl who disarms and eventually drives her boss Helena to suicide. Now she is being asked to step into the other role, that of the older Helena. She departs with her assistant to rehearse in Sils Maria; a remote region of the Alps. A young Hollywood starlet with a penchant for scandal is to take on the role of Sigrid, and Maria finds herself on the other side of the mirror, face to face with an ambiguously charming woman who is, in essence, an unsettling reflection of herself.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2452254, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 11774}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German", "Swiss German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:09:24.877000000", "metacritic": 78, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A veteran actress comes face-to-face with an uncomfortable reflection of herself when she agrees to take part in a revival of the play that launched her career 20 years earlier.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTg3MDE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ1ODQyNTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1428624000000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Clouds of Sils Maria", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.8M", "consensus": "Bolstered by a trio of powerful performances from its talented leads, Clouds of Sils Maria is an absorbing, richly detailed drama with impressive depth and intelligence.", "critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 135, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1436832000000, "fresh": 120, "lastUpdated": 1441905202000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 9449, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.ifcfilms.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Olivier Assayas (screenplay)"], "year": 2014}
