He's just back from a business trip (he brokers diamonds) and their teen daughter Avery is sneaking out to a party, when four thugs in security uniforms and ski masks stage a home invasion. They want what's in the safe: cash and diamonds. Kyle stalls them, trying to negotiate for Sarah's freedom. Over the next few hours, the back stories of the four robbers (two brothers, a girlfriend, and the representative of a local drug kingpin) as well as the fault lines in Kyle and Sarah's marriage come into play. Is there room here for heroism?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1674784, "rating": 5.3, "votes": 32027}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:42:51.137000000", "metacritic": 37, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "As they're held for ransom, a husband and wife's predicament grows more dire amid the discovery of betrayal and deception.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTc0Mzk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA4NDUyNg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1319155200000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Trespass", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$16.8k", "consensus": "Another claustrophobic thriller that Joel Schumacher can churn out in his sleep, Trespass is nasty and aggressive, more unpleasant than entertaining.", "critic": {"meter": 10, "numReviews": 70, "rating": 3.3}, "dvd": 1320105600000, "fresh": 7, "lastUpdated": 1442435622000, "production": "Millennium Entertainment", "rotten": 63, "viewer": {"meter": 22, "numReviews": 7026, "rating": 2.5}, "website": "http://www.trespass-the-movie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Karl Gajdusek"], "year": 2011}
