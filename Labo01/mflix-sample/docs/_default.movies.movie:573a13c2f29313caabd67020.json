In long flashbacks we see a trip to the continent he took with his only friend Bunny, an outgoing, inveterate gambler. The European trip is a bit dull (Stephen wants to visit every museum imaginable) until one night in Poland they meet Eloisa, a Spanish waitress, and offer to drive her home for her city's fiesta. We can guess that the trip won't end well - because Stephen is now stuck in his flat with occasional visits from Bunny - but will anything in the reverie move Stephen to action?", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1251725, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 3840}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:22:21.683000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young shut-in takes an imaginary road trip inside his apartment, based on mementos and memories of a European trek from years before.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0ODVhNTItNDYyZC00ZjU5LTgxNTMtZmY2MjJkOTU2MTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1259280000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Bunny and the Bull", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 31, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1303776000000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1439835645000, "production": "Warp X", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 3423, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul King (screenplay)"], "year": 2009}
