Every year he spends a couple of weeks with his sons Sage, 9, and Frey, 7. Lenny juggles his kids and everything else all within a midtown studio apartment in New York City. He ultimately faces the choice of being their father or their friend all with the idea that these two weeks must last 6 months. In these two weeks, a trip upstate, visitors from strange lands, a mother, a girlfriend, \"magic\" blankets, and complete lawlessness seem to take over their lives. The film is a swan song to excuses and responsibilities; to fatherhood and self-created experiences, and to what it's like to be truly torn between being a child and being an adult.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1426362, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 666}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:45:56.323000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A father juggling his kids with the rest of his responsibilities is ultimately faced with the choice of being their father or their friend.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc0MDM2MDI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk0ODM0NDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1272412800000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Go Get Some Rosemary", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439923841000, "production": "IFC Films", "viewer": {"meter": 24, "numReviews": 78, "rating": 2.7}, "website": "http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/daddy-longlegs"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ronald Bronstein (with more from)", "Ben Safdie", "Joshua Safdie"], "year": 2009}
