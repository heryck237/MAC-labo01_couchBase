To them, war is a game which they know they will win and the common soldiers are the pawns on the board. When the campaign slows down, the Commander sends a squad to the top of a mountain behind enemy lines to report on the Japanese troop movements. The squad is commanded by a tough cynical Sergeant who takes no prisoners and even takes the gold from the teeth of the enemy dead. Before the mission starts, the lieutenant, who has had a cushy job due to a life of wealth and privilege, criticizes the Commander over his attitude towards the common soldier and is re-assigned to lead the squad. The veteran Sergeant wants to complete this mission as ordered, and he will do everything he can do to see that it is successful.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 51978, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 703}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-28 00:59:38.607000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "In the Pacific during World War 2, the officers live a comfortable life with good food, good drink and good quarters.
