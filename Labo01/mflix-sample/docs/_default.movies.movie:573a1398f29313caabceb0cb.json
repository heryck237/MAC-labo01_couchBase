Aging writer and philosopher, Z\u00e8non Ligre, comes to Bruges using a false name and papers to serve as a physician to the poor, establishing a clinic and steam bath. His methods and opinions are outside the mainstream, but he has the protection and friendship of the local Prior. Z\u00e8non, an aristocrat with a degree in canon law, lives humbly. He learns of bacchanals under Masonic signs involving monks and women, and he warns those involved. The Prior is dying, and he urges Z\u00e8non to flee to England. Z\u00e8non burns his writing. Will he leave or will he face ecclesiastical accusers and, perhaps, the stake?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 95773, "rating": 7, "votes": 202}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 01:00:15.993000000", "plot": "In the sixteenth century, Spain occupies Flanders, an Inquisition enforces the faith.
