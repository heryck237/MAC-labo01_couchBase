Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster awaits the return of Thor although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall, who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki. Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 1981115, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 357543}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:02:51.940000000", "metacritic": 54, "plot": "When Dr Jane Foster gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must protect it before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their hands on it to take over the remains of Earth.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNzAwOTUxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE0OTc5OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1383868800000, "runtime": 112, "title": "Thor: The Dark World", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$206.4M", "consensus": "It may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but Thor: The Dark World still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect.", "critic": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 241, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1393286400000, "fresh": 160, "lastUpdated": 1442079449000, "production": "Walt Disney Pictures", "rotten": 81, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 304215, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/ThorMovie"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Christopher Yost (screenplay)", "Christopher Markus (screenplay)", "Stephen McFeely (screenplay)", "Don Payne (story)", "Robert Rodat (story)", "Stan Lee (comic book)", "Larry Lieber (comic book)", "Jack Kirby (comic book)"], "year": 2013}
