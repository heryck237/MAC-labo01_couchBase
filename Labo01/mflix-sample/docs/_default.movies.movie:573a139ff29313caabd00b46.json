A bluesman, Paul Pena, blind and recently widowed, taught himself throat singing and was by chance invited to the 1995 throat-singing symposium in Kyzyl. Helped by the \"Friends of Tuva,\" Pena makes the arduous journey. Singing in the deep, rumbling kargyraa style, Pena gives inspired performances at the festival, composes songs in Tuvan, washes his face in sacred rivers, expresses the disorientation of blindness in foreign surroundings, and makes a human connection with everyone he meets.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 187859, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1144}, "languages": ["English", "Tuvinian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:58:09.880000000", "plot": "San Francisco bluesman and composer, Paul Pe\u00e8a makes a musical pilgrimage to the land of Tuva.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAwNTI4NTczNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE3NDQyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 941068800000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Genghis Blues", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 12, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 975974400000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1442340728000, "production": "Roxie Releasing", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 1112, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Roko Belic"], "year": 1999}
