Following Nim's extraordinary journey through human society, and the enduring impact he makes on the people he meets along the way, the film is an unflinching and unsentimental biography of an animal we tried to make human. What we learn about his true nature - and indeed our own - is comic, revealing and profoundly unsettling.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1814836, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 6962}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 13:02:10.783000000", "metacritic": 83, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Tells the story of a chimpanzee taken from its mother at birth and raised like a human child by a family in a brownstone on the upper West Side in the 1970s.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNjc1NTIzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY2MDI2NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1313107200000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Project Nim", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.4M", "consensus": "Equal parts hilarious, poignant, and heartbreaking, Project Nim not only tells a compelling story masterfully, but also raises the flag on the darker side of human nature.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 132, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1328572800000, "fresh": 129, "lastUpdated": 1442164263000, "production": "Roadside Attractions", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 10001, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.project-nim.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Elizabeth Hess (book)"], "year": 2011}
