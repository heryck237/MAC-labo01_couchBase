Cherri and Rod are the high-school king and queen and they justifiably rule their domain. Spud, the new kid in town, accidentally offends both Cherri and Rod and so is forced to become Cherri's slave. Naturally, they immediately hate each other, but of course later they fall in love. Cherri and Spud secretly decide to go to the prom together, and on prom night a rejected Rod forces their car off the road and into the lake. In true 50's ballad style, their car sinks to the bottom of the lake as they share one last kiss. While the bodies of Cherri and Spud lie in a timeless embrace, Rod is successful in thwarting any investigation and is able to get away with murder. On the night of the following year's prom, the car magically comes to life and slowly drives out of the lake with Cherri and Spud, as if nothing had happened, only this time their bodies are in an advanced state of decomposition. Their rusty and water-logged car drives to the prom and just as Rod is about to crown himself new king of the prom, Cherri and Spud enter the ballroom - the spotlight follows them as they cross the dance floor, with all the attendees in shock. As they approach the stage, spiders, bugs, snakes, lizards and fish ooze from their sagging skin and skeletal bodies, and the prom attendees freak as they mount the stairs to the stage. Spud takes the crown and places it on Cherri as the animals attack and devour Rod.", "genres": ["Animation", "Comedy", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 365296, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 664}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 01:04:40.870000000", "metacritic": 61, "plot": "A gothic '50s high-school comedy about a love-triangle that goes terribly bad, as two young, murdered teens returning to their prom to get revenge.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFlZTExNDQtNjFiMy00YTNjLThhYzItNDAzNWE3ZTVhNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1113955200000, "runtime": 78, "title": "Hair High", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Plympton"], "year": 2004}
