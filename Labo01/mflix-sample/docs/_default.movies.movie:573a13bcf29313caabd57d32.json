In classic Hollywood fashion, we get to follow two teenagers on their journey... straight into each others arms. But there isn't enough time. Just one week. Sometimes life's greatest decisions have to be made at the age of sixteen. Mustafa Moradi is aching to find a girlfriend. The trouble is, girls just want him as their friend. Then suddenly he's struck by a brilliant idea: he'll simply pretend to be Italian. At Gothia Cup. And finally, a world of possibilities presents itself. On the other end of the city, Linnea is desperately searching for a guy with style, courage and a burning passion. Not an easy task for a girl living in Sweden's most tedious and ugly suburb. Who knows what would have become of her, had she not met Massimo, the most romantic Italian in the world.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 986323, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 773}, "languages": ["Swedish", "English", "Persian", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 01:00:38.030000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Mustafa Moradi is aching to find a girlfriend.
