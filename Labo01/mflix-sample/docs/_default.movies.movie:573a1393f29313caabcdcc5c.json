Little Joe's wife, the God-fearing Petunia Jackson, prays not only for her husband's mortal life, but also his eternal soul as she's afraid that if he dies now, he, despite not being an evil man, won't make it into heaven. As Little Joe is close to death, he is visited by agents of both the Lord and of Lucifer. They make a deal with him: they will give him six months to atone for the errors of his human life. Once back on Earth, he won't remember the deal but both the Lord and Lucifer will be watching over him, trying to get him to see things their way. As both sides try to get Little Joe's soul, they figure that some of the most powerful tools they have at their disposal are the women in Little Joe's life: Petunia on behalf of the Lord, and Georgia Brown, a gold-digging floozy, on behalf of Lucifer. As hard as both the Lord and Lucifer try to get Little Joe on their side, they don't factor into the equation human judgment, which turns some of their work against them.", "genres": ["Musical", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 35703, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1792}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:13:08.340000000", "plot": "A compulsive gambler dies during a shooting, but he'll receive a second chance to reform himself and to make up with his worried wife.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NzQ0Mzg5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwMTk4OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -843609600000, "runtime": 98, "title": "Cabin in the Sky", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 10, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1136851200000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1439921533000, "production": "WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 1931, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joseph Schrank (screen play)", "Lynn Root (based upon the book of the musical play by)"], "year": 1943}
