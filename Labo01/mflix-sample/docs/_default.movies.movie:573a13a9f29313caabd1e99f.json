Frantically making love all the time and almost everywhere, they regularly fight, then kiss and make up, with little else going on in their empty relationship and quite ordinary daily life--until something horrible and hideous brutally puts an end to their trip.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 315110, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 3254}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:55:55.490000000", "metacritic": 43, "plot": "David, an independent photographer, and Katia, an unemployed woman, leave Los Angeles, en route to the southern California desert, where they search a natural set to use as a backdrop for a...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc3NDc1YTQtMTE2Mi00M2NjLTkwOWMtMWZmZjZhNmNmMjczL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1063756800000, "runtime": 119, "title": "Twentynine Palms", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A muddled and inconsequential drama.", "critic": {"meter": 42, "numReviews": 38, "rating": 4.9}, "dvd": 1095724800000, "fresh": 16, "lastUpdated": 1440097629000, "production": "Wellspring", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 1525, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://tadrart.com/29palms/US/US.htm"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bruno Dumont"], "year": 2003}
