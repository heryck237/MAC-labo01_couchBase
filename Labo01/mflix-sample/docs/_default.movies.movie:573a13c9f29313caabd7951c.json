Gabi, a rambunctious Oberlin undergrad, heads to New York City to spend the summer with her older brother, Sam, seeking solidarity in the wake of her parents' divorce. When she gets there, she finds Sam too busy juggling women and too irked by her provocative antics and almost constant nudity to give her the guidance she needs. In an effort to get Sam's attention, Gabi seduces his free-loving, freeloading college buddy, only to find she's in over her head.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1520888, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 220}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-19 00:06:25.993000000", "metacritic": 58, "plot": "An ambitious painter on the verge of a big break confronts his moral decay when his idealist, hell-raising, younger sister comes to stay with him in New York City for the summer.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NDU0Njk3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM1NTM1OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1267228800000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Gabi on the Roof in July", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 6.6}, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1440356481000, "production": "FilmBuff", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 121, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.gabiontheroofinjuly.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kate Kirtz", "Lawrence Michael Levine"], "year": 2010}
