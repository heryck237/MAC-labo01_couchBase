Kinshasa is an inviting place. With petrol in short supply in DRC's capital, he and his sidekick pursue a plot to get hold of a secret cache - barrels of fuel they can sell for a huge profit. Of course they're not the only ones who want the stuff. Cesar is a ruthless, sharply dressed foreigner thriving in Kinshasa's lawless streets. A female military officer joins the fray. Even the church will betray its tenets for a piece of the action. But Riva's main nemesis is Azor, a crime boss in the classic style: big, decadent and brutal. He's not a man to mess with, but his girlfriend, Nora, may just be the most seductive woman in all of DRC. Riva catches sight of her dancing at a nightclub and it's not long before Nora matches the fuel cache as a coveted object of his lust.", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1723120, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 900}, "languages": ["French", "Lingala"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:15:45.017000000", "metacritic": 65, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Riva is an operator, a man with charm and ambition in equal measure.
