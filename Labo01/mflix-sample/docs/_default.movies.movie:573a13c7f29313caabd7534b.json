Once the handsome literary maverick and hero of the Beat Generation, Kerouac now sees only a vestige of his former self, ravaged by alcohol and drugs, aged beyond his years and tormented by self-doubt. Questioning his talent, his faith, and his mortality, Kerouac leaves New York for California, on a quest for redemption at an isolated, fog-banked cabin in the primitive landscape of the Big Sur woods. What ensues in those fateful 3 weeks of August, 1960, is both terrifying and revelatory. While Kerouac is able to find beauty and elation in his surroundings, the dichotomy of his psyche renders him unable to face his demons alone. He sets off on a visceral collision course of paranoia, sex, delirium tremens, misery and madness. His desperation culminates in an intense, hallucinatory breakdown, but the duality of his nature (again) comes into play and he emerges from his dark place - however fleeting - with a modicum of peace and optimism.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1462411, "rating": 5.8, "votes": 1281}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:56.673000000", "metacritic": 49, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A recounting of Jack Kerouac's (here known by the name of his fictional alter-ego Jack Duluoz) three sojourns to the cabin in Big Sur, owned by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDU0MDY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY3NjUzMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1383264000000, "runtime": 81, "title": "Big Sur", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$35.9k", "critic": {"meter": 45, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 1389657600000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1442080921000, "production": "Ketchup Entertainment", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 39, "numReviews": 1033, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/BigSurMovie"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jack Kerouac (novel)", "Michael Polish (screenplay)"], "year": 2013}
