An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 56058, "rating": 8.7, "votes": 16879}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:22:17.553000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An elder ronin samurai arrives at a feudal lord's home and requests an honorable place to commit suicide.
