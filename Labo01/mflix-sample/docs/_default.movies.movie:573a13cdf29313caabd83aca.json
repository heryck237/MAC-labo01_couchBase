But accomplished singer, harpsichordist, violinist Nannerl, Wolfgang's elder by five years, first held forth as the family's infant prodigy. At the film begins, she is still performing, though overshadowed and sidelined as accompanist by Wolfgang's growing fame. Her father bows to social strictures \"for her own good,\" refusing to let her continue with the violin or compose, while privately conceding Nannerl's talent to his wife. No longer a precocious tot, Nannerl chafes at the limitations imposed by her gender and frets about her prospects.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 1653911, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 1150}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:24:56.110000000", "metacritic": 71, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A reimagined account of the early life of Maria Anna 'Nannerl' Mozart, five years older than Wolfgang, and a musical prodigy in her own right.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMDM4MDA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUwNjkwNg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1276041600000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Mozart's Sister", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ren\u00e8 F\u00e8ret (scenario)"], "year": 2010}
