Back stateside we follow four of them - a surgeon who saw too much, a teacher who's a single mom and who lost a hand in the ambush, an infantry man whose best friend died that day, and a soldier who keeps reliving the moment he killed a civilian woman. Each of the four has come home changed, each feels dislocation. Group therapy, V.A. services, halting gestures from family and colleagues, and regular flashbacks keep the war front and center in their minds. They're angry, touchy, and explosive: can a warrior find peace back home?", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 763840, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 9039}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "Arabic"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:14:57.707000000", "metacritic": 42, "plot": "Three soldiers struggle to readjust to life at home after returning home from a lengthy tour in Iraq.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NjkwNDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkyNjgzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1172707200000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Home of the Brave", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The ensemble cast works hard, but hammy direction and a script lacking in nuance ruins this movie's noble intentions.", "critic": {"meter": 23, "numReviews": 57, "rating": 4.1}, "dvd": 1193097600000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1439835836000, "production": "MGM", "rotten": 44, "viewer": {"meter": 46, "numReviews": 22193, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.mgm.com/homeofthebrave/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Friedman (screenplay)", "Mark Friedman (story)", "Irwin Winkler (story)"], "year": 2006}
