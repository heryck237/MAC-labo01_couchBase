Pierre is a political reporter, assigned to write a fluff piece on Katya, a blond who acts in slasher movies and a Fox show about single girls in the city. The interview, at a restaurant, goes badly: she's late, he's unprepared and rude. After leaving, he bangs his head in a fender bender and she takes him to her loft to clean the wound. Lubricated by alcohol and competitive natures, the interview resumes. She takes phone calls from her fianc\u00e8, Pierre reads her diary on her computer. They discuss wounds, he expresses concern, father-daughter feelings arise. Out come camcorders to tape their darkest secrets. Is friendship or more in the offing?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 480269, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 11822}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:36:17.160000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "After falling out with his editor, a fading political journalist is forced to interview America's most popular soap actress.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNTA3MTgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYxNDk0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1178755200000, "runtime": 84, "title": "Interview", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.3M", "consensus": "Captivating performances from Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller make a seemingly simple premise gripping and entertaining.", "critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 122, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1197331200000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1441136600000, "production": "Sony Classics", "rotten": 52, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 25826, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/interview/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Schechter", "Theo van Gogh (based on the film by)", "Theodor Holman (screenplay)", "Hans Teeuwen (idea)", "Steve Buscemi (screenplay)"], "year": 2007}
