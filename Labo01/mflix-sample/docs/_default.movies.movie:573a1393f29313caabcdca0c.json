In dramatizations, we see a farmer beaten for speaking up at a meeting, a union man murdered in a boarding house, two sharecroppers near Fort Smith Arkansas shot by men deputized by the local sheriff, a spy stealing the names of union members, and a dead Chicago union man eulogized. In archival footage we witness police and goons beating lawfully assembled union organizers, and we see men at work and union families at play. The narration celebrates patriotism and democracy.", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 35112, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 189}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-26 00:25:21.937000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Paul Robeson narrates a mix of dramatizations and archival footage about the bill of rights being under attack during the 1930s by union busting corporations, their spies and contractors. ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY0NTczNDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MDkyOTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -872380800000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Native Land", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 764985600000, "lastUpdated": 1441135891000, "viewer": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 81, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Leo Hurwitz", "Ben Maddow", "Paul Strand"], "year": 1942}
