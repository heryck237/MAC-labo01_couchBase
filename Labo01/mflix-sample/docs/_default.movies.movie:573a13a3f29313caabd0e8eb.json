Johnathan accepts and learns the ropes of Rollerball: The players are on Rollerblades, trying to bring a heavy metal ball into a high goal. Also, there are motorcyclists around to bring momentum to the players. Oh yes, and there are no rules in the game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. So, Alexi starts to bribe members of the different teams to cause more trouble than necessary on the field, and the viewers love it. Only a little later, Johnathan's life is already in extreme danger as well as those of his friends and teammates. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival against their real opponent - their boss Alexi Petrovich.", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 246894, "rating": 2.9, "votes": 21493}, "languages": ["English", "Russian", "French", "Arabic", "Korean", "German", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:57:43.517000000", "metacritic": 14, "plot": "The big thing in 2005 is a violent sport which can have some pretty serious consequences... like dying.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3OTk4NDE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAyOTY2NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1013126400000, "runtime": 98, "title": "Rollerball", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$18.9M", "consensus": "Removing the social critique of the original, this updated version of Rollerball is violent, confusing, and choppy.
