Being the big opportunity for Michael it also means moving on without his friends and threatening the unwritten laws of loyalty. Stuck in a paradox that only grows bigger, Michael puts all focus on the music hoping things will resolve themselves. But his friends lose patience and with a talent big enough to gradually take over more and more of Apollos spotlight, a showdown seems inevitable...
