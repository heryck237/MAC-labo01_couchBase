He leaves the closet and New York, opens a camera shop that becomes the salon for San Francisco's growing gay community, and organizes gays' purchasing power to build political alliances. He runs for office with lover Scott Smith as his campaign manager. Victory finally comes on the same day Dan White wins in the city's conservative district. The rest of the film sketches Milk's relationship with White and the 1978 fight against a statewide initiative to bar gays and their supporters from public school jobs.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1013753, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 126879}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:06:06.883000000", "metacritic": 84, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of Harvey Milk, and his struggles as an American gay activist who fought for gay rights and became California's first openly gay elected official.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2OTM5NjUzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY1MTM5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1233273600000, "runtime": 128, "title": "Milk", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$31.7M", "consensus": "Anchored by Sean Penn's powerhouse performance, Milk is a triumphant account of America's first openly gay man elected to public office.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 229, "rating": 8}, "dvd": 1236643200000, "fresh": 215, "lastUpdated": 1442082897000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 14, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 176577, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.filminfocus.com/focusfeatures/film/milk/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dustin Lance Black"], "year": 2008}
