Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: \"we're all out there looking for true love\", which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she get's herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is \"it\".", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 282410, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 1092}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:33:10.313000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A young woman tries to find the right man to be with while dealing with her own life and family problems.", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1032652800000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Chance", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442140634000, "production": "Benson Entertainment Inc.", "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 1205, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.chancemovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Amber Benson"], "year": 2002}
