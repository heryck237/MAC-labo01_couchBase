Bright Leaves describes a journey taken across the social, economic, and psychological tobacco terrain of North Carolina by a native Carolinian, Ross McElwee, whose great-grandfather created the famous brand of tobacco known as Bull Durham. The comedic chronicle is a subjective, autobiographical meditation on the allure of cigarettes and their troubling legacy for the state of North Carolina. It's also a film about family history, addiction, denial, and filmmaking--as McElwee, noted director of Sherman's March, grapples with the legacy of an obscure Hollywood melodrama that is purportedly based on this curious man that was his great-grandfather.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 372806, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 498}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:03:34.580000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "North Carolina produces more tobacco than any other state in America.
