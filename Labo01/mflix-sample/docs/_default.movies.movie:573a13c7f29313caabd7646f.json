Roosevelt, to help him relax at his family estate. That aid soon develops into much more as they become lovers. That puts Daisy in a unique position as Roosevelt receives the King and Queen of Britain in 1939 for a visit. As the Royal couple copes with the President's oddly plebeian arrangements, Daisy learns that there is far more to Roosevelt's life than she realized. With the world about to be set ablaze by war, friendships are struck and perspectives are gained on that special weekend that would make all the difference with a great, but very human, president.", "genres": ["Biography", "Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1477855, "rating": 5.8, "votes": 8540}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 01:13:00.090000000", "metacritic": 55, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The story of the love affair between FDR and his distant cousin Margaret \"Daisy\" Suckley, centered around the weekend in 1939 when the King and Queen of the United Kingdom visited upstate New York.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MzU3Nzc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5NDI4Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1359676800000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Hyde Park on Hudson", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.4M", "consensus": "Though bolstered by a thoroughly charming performance by Bill Murray in the central role, Hyde Park on Hudson is an FDR biopic that lets down both its audience and its subject.", "critic": {"meter": 36, "numReviews": 161, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 1365465600000, "fresh": 58, "lastUpdated": 1442425122000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 103, "viewer": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 10507, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://focusfeatures.com/hyde_park_on_hudson"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Richard Nelson"], "year": 2012}
