He tries to imitate Travolta's impersonation in every detail, to be able to perform the most perfect Tony Manero himself. Ra\u00e8l lives in a shabby house in Santiago. In a spacious room the landlady Wilma has a simple stage, where Ra\u00e8l and some other tenants rehearse a show in Tony Moreno style. The young performers Goyo and Pauli are involved in underground activities against the Pinochet regime. Goyo gives some political flyers to a man. Ra\u00e8l tails the man, and happens to see the secret police shooting him. After a while Ra\u00e8l returns to the corpse, and steals the man's wristwatch. He goes to a junk dealer, where he swaps the watch for some thick glass bricks. He needs these for the stage floor, to be able to light up the show from beneath, just as in the film. In need of more glass bricks, he kills the junk dealer and steals the bricks. In his new Tony Moreno dress Ra\u00e8l is on his way to a look-alike contest in TV Chile, when the secret police enters the house to arrest Pauli and other political suspects. Ra\u00e8l succeeds to sneak away over the roof, and continues to the TV studio.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1223975, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2114}, "languages": ["Spanish", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:01:10.423000000", "metacritic": 72, "plot": "A man is obsessed with John Travolta's disco dancing character from Saturday Night Fever (1977).", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5ODQ3NzI3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5NDA4MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-MA", "released": 1219881600000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Tony Manero", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Deliberately provocative, Tony Manero is as challenging and compelling as it is difficult to describe.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 33, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1275350400000, "fresh": 28, "lastUpdated": 1440613205000, "production": "Sophie Dulac Distribution", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 6125, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Alfredo Castro", "Mateo Iribarren", "Pablo Larra\u00e8n"], "year": 2008}
