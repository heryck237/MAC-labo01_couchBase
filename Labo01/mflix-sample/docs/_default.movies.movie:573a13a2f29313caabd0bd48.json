Marc Singer goes underground to live with them, and films this \"family.\" A dozen or so men and one woman talk about their lives: horrors of childhood, jail time, losing children, being coke-heads. They scavenge, they've built themselves sturdy one-room shacks; they have pets, cook, chat, argue, give each other haircuts. A bucket is their toilet. Leaky overhead pipes are a source of water for showers. They live in virtual darkness. During the filming, Amtrak gives a 30-day eviction notice.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 235327, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 5255}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:22:58.417000000", "metacritic": 75, "plot": "A cinematic portrait of the homeless population who live permanently in the underground tunnels of New York City.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NjM1NjM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxMDgyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 984096000000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Dark Days", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Marc Singer's documentary about a group of homeless people living beneath the streets of New York City is haunting and uplifting in equal measure.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 67, "rating": 7.9}, "dvd": 1001376000000, "fresh": 63, "lastUpdated": 1438715521000, "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 6187, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2000}
