Night and Fog, named after Nuit et brouillard (1955), Alain Resnais' documentary about concentration camps, looks at the difficult problem of domestic violence. An elderly man from Hong Kong takes a wife from outside the city and goes on to neglect and abuse the woman. Ann Hui's cool registering camera is juxtaposed with flashbacks within flashbacks and dream sequences, just as in her earlier film, Song of the Exile (1990).", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1392249, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 349}, "languages": ["Mandarin", "Cantonese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:30:02.283000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Starts at the end of the story, with the brutal murder by a man of his wife and daughters.
