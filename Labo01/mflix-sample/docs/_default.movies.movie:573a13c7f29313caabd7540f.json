The Sanmo-kai chairman learns that his henchman Ikemoto has struck an alliance with the drug-dealing Murase family, and is not best pleased, to say the least. The ensuing retaliation triggers an orgy of killings, territorial invasions and score settling while law enforcement officers are too corrupt to intervene.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1462667, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 8271}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:19:52.537000000", "metacritic": 67, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The boss of a major crime syndicate orders his lieutenant to bring a rogue gang of drug traffickers in line, a job that gets passed on to his long-suffering subordinate.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTdlYTZmNDctYzFlYy00ODc1LThiY2YtNjMzNDNlMjQwNzYzL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1276300800000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Outrage", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$3.6k", "critic": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 39, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1327968000000, "fresh": 30, "lastUpdated": 1442423399000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 3455, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.outragefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Takeshi Kitano (screenplay)"], "year": 2010}
