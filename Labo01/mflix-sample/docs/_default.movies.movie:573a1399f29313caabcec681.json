Half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the 'All-American' athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while 'Dough' succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre, who is lucky to have a father, 'Furious' Styles, to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 101507, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 85638}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:25:26.987000000", "metacritic": 73, "plot": "Follows the lives of three young males living in the Crenshaw ghetto of Los Angeles, dissecting questions of race, relationships, violence and future prospects.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRjNDI5NTgtOTIwMC00MzJhLWI4ZTYtMmU0ZTE3ZmRkZDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 679276800000, "runtime": 112, "title": "Boyz n the Hood", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 49, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 983836800000, "fresh": 47, "lastUpdated": 1439837227000, "production": "Columbia Pictures", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 142628, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Singleton"], "year": 1991}
