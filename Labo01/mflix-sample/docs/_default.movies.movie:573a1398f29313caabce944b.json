The crew is busy, still setting up. Then, three more musicians and two back-up singers join the band. Everybody sings, plays, harmonizes, dances, and runs. They change instruments and clothes. Bryne appears in the Big Suit. The backdrop is often black, but sometimes it displays words, images, or children's drawings. The band cooks for 18 songs, the lyrics are clear, the house rocks. In this concert film, the Talking Heads hardly talk, don't stop, and always make sense.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 88178, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 7691}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:56:16.837000000", "metacritic": 89, "plot": "An innovative concert movie for the rock group The Talking Heads.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUxZmZmYzQtMzgzNy00OGVmLWE5M2ItOTA5MTZiMTk4MTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 469411200000, "runtime": 88, "title": "Stop Making Sense", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jonathan Demme", "Talking Heads"], "year": 1984}
