Michael had been ousted from his home town due to his gambling indiscretions and had left his wife to deal with the mess he created.

In the process, he obtains a job working with his mother's new husband as an armored car driver. He almost seems the perfect prodigal son as he finds his niche back in the community and his way back into his ex's heart. His troubles surmount when he and his wife are caught in the act by her hoodlum boyfriend/fianc\u00e8.
