She sets off to Bombay to win the title of Miss India--a launching pad to fame and a surefire way to stand out in a country of 1.2 billion people. Just hours from the Miss India beauty boot camp is another training ground for girls--that of the Durga Vahini, a Hindu nationalist group exclusively for women. Here we meet Prachi Trivedi, a young, fearsome drill sergeant training Indian girls to fight against Western culture, Islam and Christianity by any means necessary including violence. Gliding back and forth between the action of the two camps, the dreams and conflicts of India and young Indian women are laid bare-- the two opposing worlds aren't as far away from each other as they seem.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 2258685, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 595}, "languages": ["English", "Hindi"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:11:05.803000000", "metacritic": 77, "plot": "Two young women follow completely divergent paths in the new, modernizing India-one wants to become Miss India, the other is a fierce Hindu Nationalist prepared to kill and die for her beliefs.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAyOTEyMzc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg4NjI0OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-PG", "released": 1396915200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "The World Before Her", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1375660800000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1441991817000, "production": "Cinedigm Entertainment", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 350, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.worldbeforeher.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Nisha Pahuja"], "year": 2012}
