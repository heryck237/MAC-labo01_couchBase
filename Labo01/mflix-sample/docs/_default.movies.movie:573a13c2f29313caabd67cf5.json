These eleven people are also prepared to be photographed for a calendar, and photographed naked, allowing people who would otherwise glance furtively at thalidomiders to take a good, long look. In the process Niko discovers a range of fascinating characters who have learned to lead an impressively \"normal\" life, which incorporates their disability. With black humour, and paying no heed to political correctness, NOBODY'S PERFECT gives a portrait of twelve extraordinary personalities who react with curiosity, enthusiasm or horror (like Niko himself) to the project.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1266093, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 95}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 23:36:41.090000000", "metacritic": 59, "plot": "NOBODY'S PERFECT is a documentary which shows Niko von Glasow's search for eleven people who, like him, were born disabled due to the side effects of the drug thalidomide.
