Rob and Sophia are a happily married couple, except for the fact that she has never experienced sexual climax. This irony follows her to work because she is a couples counselor who frequently has to deal with the sexual issues other couples have. Two of her patients are Jamie and James, a gay couple who have been monogamous for five years and counting. James wants to bring other men in to the relationship, and his own history with depression may hint at an ulterior motive. Ceth (pronounced Seth) may be the perfect addition to their family, but Caleb, a voyeur from across the street, may have his own ideas about that. Sophia visits Severin, a dominatrix with secrets of her own to reveal.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 367027, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 25957}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:15:49.093000000", "metacritic": 64, "plot": "A group of New Yorkers caught up in their romantic-sexual milieu converge at an underground salon infamous for its blend of art, music, politics, and carnality.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjkwMTk1OWMtZjg4ZC00YWVlLTkyZGItZTU4ZjQ5NDM0M2NkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1161302400000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Shortbus", "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Cameron Mitchell"], "year": 2006}
