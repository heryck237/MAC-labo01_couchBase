He emerges into a world of about 60 teen boys who have learned to survive in a completely enclosed environment, subsisting on their own agriculture and supplies. A new boy arrives every 30 days. The original group has been in \"The Glade\" for three years, trying to find a way to escape through the Maze that surrounds their living space. They have begun to give up hope. Then a comatose girl arrives with a strange note, and their world begins to change. There are some great, fast-paced action scenes, particularly those involving the nightmarish Grievers who plague the boys.", "genres": ["Action", "Mystery", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 1790864, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 246258}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 17:22:13.297000000", "metacritic": 56, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow \"runners\" for a shot at escape.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUyNTA3MTAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEyMTkyMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1411084800000, "runtime": 113, "title": "The Maze Runner", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$102.4M", "consensus": "With strong acting, a solid premise, and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, The Maze Runner stands out from the crowded field of YA sci-fi adventures.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 145, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1418688000000, "fresh": 92, "lastUpdated": 1440525867000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 53, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 90041, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://themazerunnermovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Noah Oppenheim (screenplay)", "Grant Pierce Myers (screenplay)", "T.S.
