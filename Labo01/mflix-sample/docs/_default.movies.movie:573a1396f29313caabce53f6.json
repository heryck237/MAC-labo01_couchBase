Federico Fellini's film combines the free form and make-believe splendor with the comic, bittersweet feeling for character and narrative we remember from some of his best films of the 1950s. The town in the film is based on Rimini, where Mr. Fellini grew up. Yet there is now something magical, larger-than-life about the town, its citizens and many of the things that happen to them.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 71129, "rating": 8, "votes": 27117}, "languages": ["Italian", "Greek", " Ancient (to 1453)"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:25:16.870000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A series of comedic and nostalgic vignettes set in a 1930s Italian coastal town.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI2OTg2NDQtMzc0MC00MjRiLWI1NzAtMjY2ZDMwMmUyNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MTUwNTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 148780800000, "runtime": 123, "title": "Amarcord", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Ribald, sweet, and sentimental, Amarcord is a larger-than-life journey through a seaside village and its colorful citizens.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 42, "rating": 8.2}, "dvd": 891561600000, "fresh": 38, "lastUpdated": 1440355267000, "production": "Janus Films", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 17866, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Federico Fellini (story)", "Tonino Guerra (story)", "Federico Fellini (screenplay)", "Tonino Guerra (screenplay)"], "year": 1973}
