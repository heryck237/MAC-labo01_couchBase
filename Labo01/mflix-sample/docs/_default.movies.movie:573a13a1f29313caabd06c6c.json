She is a beautiful, silent outsider who's moved to this Sicilian town to be with her husband, Nino. He promptly goes off to war, leaving her to the lustful eyes of the men and the sharp tongues of the women. During the next few years, as Renato grows toward manhood, he watches Mal\u00e8na suffer and prove her mettle. He sees her loneliness, then grief when Nino is reported dead, the effects of slander on her relationship with her father, her poverty and search for work, and final humiliations. Will Renato learn courage from Mal\u00e8na and stand up for her?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 213847, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 59546}, "languages": ["Italian", "English", "Latin", "Greek", " Ancient (to 1453)"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 01:25:18.317000000", "metacritic": 54, "plot": "A woman provokes sensual awakenings in a group of adolescent boys.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViM2E0MjktZTdlNy00Y2M0LThlN2UtZThkZGNlMWIyMmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 981072000000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Mal\u00e8na", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Malena ends up objectifying the character of the movie's title.
