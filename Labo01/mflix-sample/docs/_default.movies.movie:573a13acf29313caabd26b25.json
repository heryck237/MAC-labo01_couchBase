The stories include: A husband trying to scare his wife; a man stuck at a creepy \"healthy hotel\"; a school teacher spooked by a child's homework; a housewife scared of apples; a bizarre lift on a freeway; and a college kid with an unusual power. Unlike the usual Indian horror film, this does not resort to sound effects and visuals for thrills. Each sketch has its moments, though a couple of them could have been brilliant with small script changes, and a resistance to oversimplifying. Most of the actors do decent jobs, especially Raghubir Yadav as the freaked-out school-teacher.", "genres": ["Horror", "Adventure"], "imdb": {"id": 349333, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 1736}, "languages": ["Hindi"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-09 00:11:24.320000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Seven friends, after their car breaks down in the middle of the night, find shelter and tell one another stories to kill time till dawn.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0Njk4NTQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2ODgzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1059091200000, "runtime": 121, "title": "Darna Mana Hai", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1069113600000, "lastUpdated": 1441995675000, "viewer": {"meter": 37, "numReviews": 979, "rating": 3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Atul Sabharwal", "Rajnish Thakur", "Abbas Tyrewala"], "year": 2003}
