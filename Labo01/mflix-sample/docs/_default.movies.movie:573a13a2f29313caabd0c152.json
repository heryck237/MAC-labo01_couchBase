The themes are Blacks and Whites, men and women, old-school and hip-hop. Steve Harvey emcees, celebrates '70s music and lyrics of love, and pokes at folks in the front row. D.L. Hughley mines racial differences and talks about his marriage. Cedric the Entertainer riffs on a Black president and on being grown up. Bernie Mac, who says he expresses what's in the back of our minds, closes with reflections on being 42 (new aspects to his sex life and his attitude toward children). Spike Lee's camera takes us backstage and off-stage with the Kings and into the crowd where everyone's laughing.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 236388, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 4574}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 01:05:33.227000000", "metacritic": 76, "plot": "A concert film featuring four major African American stand up comedians.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDY1NDU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcyNTMyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 966556800000, "runtime": 115, "title": "The Original Kings of Comedy", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$37.7M", "consensus": "If you want lots of laughs and don't mind some profanity, The Original Kings of Comedy can deliver.", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 88, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 983232000000, "fresh": 76, "lastUpdated": 1440182158000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 12, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 17785, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.kingsofcomedymovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cedric the Entertainer", "Steve Harvey", "D.L.
