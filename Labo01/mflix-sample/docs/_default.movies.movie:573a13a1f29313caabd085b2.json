This film turns it into a feature about economic and familial politics. Frank, a business school graduate, returns to his provincial hometown to take a management position in the factory where his father has been working for 30 years. First Frank makes the mistake of actually asking the workers on the assembly line for their opinions. Then upper management manipulates his findings to lay off employees. This creates a huge rift, not only between labor and management, but between father and son. A human morality tale that evokes paternal and filial love, and illustrates the personal risk behind political ideas.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 220726, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2085}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:05:58.053000000", "metacritic": 78, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The 35-hour work week has all of France in its thrall.
