Right at the outset, they are given false names with the intention that they won't get too close and will concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But, when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members, and two of them are killed in the subsequent shootout, along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 105236, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 586480}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:01:40.220000000", "metacritic": 78, "plot": "After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmExNmEwYWItYmQzOS00YjA5LTk2MjktZjEyZDE1Y2QxNjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 715392000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Reservoir Dogs", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 61, "rating": 8.8}, "dvd": 1036454400000, "fresh": 56, "lastUpdated": 1442080317000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 440962, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Quentin Tarantino", "Roger Avary (background radio dialog)", "Quentin Tarantino (background radio dialog)"], "year": 1992}
