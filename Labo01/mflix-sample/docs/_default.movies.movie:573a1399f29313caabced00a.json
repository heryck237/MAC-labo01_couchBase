He writes a few columns for the Catholic paper, and soon workers are listening and the powerful are in an uproar. He's expelled from the Catholic party, so he starts the Christian Democrats and is elected to Parliament. After Rome disciplines him, he must choose between two callings, as priest and as champion of workers. In subplots, a courageous young woman falls in love with a socialist and survives a shop foreman's rape; children die; prelates play billiards.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 104046, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 2868}, "languages": ["Flemish", "Dutch", "French", "Latin", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:04:18.410000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In the 1890s, Father Adolf Daens goes to Aalst, a textile town where child labor is rife, pay and working conditions are horrible, the poor have no vote, and the Catholic church backs the ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTgzOTE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI3MzIyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 730598400000, "runtime": 138, "title": "Daens", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 830822400000, "lastUpdated": 1438800943000, "production": "Favourite Films", "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 559, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Louis Paul Boon (novel)", "Fran\u00e8ois Chevallier", "Stijn Coninx", "Addy Weijers (scenario consultant)"], "year": 1992}
