These uniquely talented deaf entertainers of various disciplines overcome great challenges on their way to personal triumphs and professional success. Bob, a drummer in the world's only deaf rock band, Beethoven's Nightmare, produces the largest show in the band's 30 year history; CJ, a hugely famous and internationally renowned comic in the Deaf world, but virtually unknown to hearing audiences, fights to cross over to the mainstream by producing the first international sign language theatre festival in Los Angeles; Robert, a brilliant actor who teaches at Juilliard, struggles to survive when he becomes homeless, his health compromised by HIV; and TL, a hard of hearing singer finds herself caught between the hearing and deaf communities when she attracts her first major producer to record her first CD \"Not Deaf Enough.\" Chronicled with rare intimacy and candor, SEE WHAT I'M SAYING: THE DEAF ENTERTAINERS DOCUMENTARY is the first open captioned commercial film in American history. At the same time, it opens the door to deaf culture as it allows the sign language in the film to be accessible to all audiences. Director Hilari Scarl captures with insight and honesty the humor and emotion, the struggles and obstacles these performers face daily, not just on stage but in life.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1125387, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 91}, "languages": ["English", "American Sign Language"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-08 00:30:03.430000000", "metacritic": 73, "plot": "This inspirational documentary follows four deaf entertainers: a comic, drummer, actor and a singer as they attempt to cross over to mainstream audiences.
