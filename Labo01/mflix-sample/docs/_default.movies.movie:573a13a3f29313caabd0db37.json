A burglar is held at gunpoint and forced to listen to a story. At the turn of the 20th Century, two brothers feud over a woman. She marries one; the other, Luke, a deadly gunslinger, becomes a soldier of fortune in Macedonia, and gets embroiled in a local revolution. He's after money. Wounded by his brother, he's nursed by a pregnant villager who urges him to \"kill for good, not for gold.\" A dying old woman in modern Manhattan tells Luke's story; her listener is Edge, a young thief who's burgled her flat to pay off crooked cops who can send him to jail. He listens with the desperate hope that he'll find gold that he thinks she has. The stories intersect when Edge sorts out the old woman's surprising connection to Luke.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Western"], "imdb": {"id": 243232, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 1780}, "languages": ["English", "Macedonian", "German", "Turkish"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-29 00:12:47.050000000", "metacritic": 41, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Two parallel tales of redemption, a century apart.
