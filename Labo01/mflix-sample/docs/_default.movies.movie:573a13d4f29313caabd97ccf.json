Each part is a palindrome, which means it reads the same both forwards and backwards. Her schoolmates are always teasing her about this, especially Anina's arch-enemy Yisel, who Anina sees as an \"elephant\". One day, Anina and Yisel get into a playground skirmish, so the school principal disciplines them with a weird punishment: they are both given a sealed black envelope which they are not allowed to open for an entire week. Haunted by nightmares and day-dreams, Anina in her anxiousness to find out what horrible punishment awaits her, will get mixed up in a series of adventures, involving secret loves, close friendships and dreadful enemies. Without her realizing it, Anina's efforts to understand the content of the envelope turns into a journey to understand the world and her place in it.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1947964, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 279}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:04:11.217000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A fantastical journey into the world of a ten-year-old girl who, following a playground skirmish, is given the weirdest punishment in the history of weird punishments.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMTU0MjAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE1MTAzOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1366329600000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Anina", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440095440000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 40, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.anina.com.uy/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Federico Ivanier (adaptation)", "Sergio L\u00e8pez Su\u00e8rez (novel)", "Federico Ivanier (screenplay)", "Alfredo Soderguit (screenplay)", "Germ\u00e8n Tejeira (screenplay)", "Juli\u00e8n Goyoaga (screenplay)", "Alejo Schettini (screenplay)"], "year": 2013}
