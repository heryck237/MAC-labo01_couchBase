They stick to the back roads and forests to steer clear of the shambling corpses that patrol the once bustling cities and towns. In order to survive, they must overcome the stark differences in each other's personalities. Ben embraces an increasingly feral, lawless, and nomadic lifestyle while Mickey is unable to accept the harsh realities of the new world and longs for the creature comforts he once took for granted. A bed, a girl, and a safe place to live. When the men intercept a radio transmission from a seemingly thriving, protected community, Mickey will stop at nothing to find it, even though it is made perfectly clear that he is not welcome.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 2272350, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 5344}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:43:13.517000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The personalities of two former baseball players clash as they traverse the rural back roads of a post-plague New England teeming with the undead.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMTk2NDcxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0ODA0OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1370304000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "The Battery", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440098469000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 64, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeremy Gardner"], "year": 2012}
