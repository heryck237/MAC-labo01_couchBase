August 1925 on a Danish farm. Widowed Patriarch Borgen, who's rather prominent in his community, has three sons: Mikkel, a good-hearted agnostic whose wife Inger is pregnant, Johannes, who believes he is Jesus, and Anders, young, slight, in love with the tailor's daughter. The fundamentalist sect of the girl's father is anathema to Borgen's traditional Lutheranism; he opposes the marriage until the tailor forbids it, then Borgen's pride demands that it happen. Unexpectedly, Inger, who is the family's sweetness and light, has problems with her pregnancy. The rational doctor arrives, and a long night brings sharp focus to at least four views of faith.", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 48452, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 8951}, "languages": ["Danish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-11 00:01:32.953000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "People believe in the dead Christ, but not in the living.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjFjYzQ4ZTgtZGQ3MS00NDE2LTlmOTktYTIwOWIwMWVkYjcxL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTc2MDU0NDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -472608000000, "runtime": 126, "title": "Ordet", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 9.4}, "dvd": 1220832000000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1442165610000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 4163, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kaj Munk (play)"], "year": 1955}
