She leaves her flat to find him. The neighbors' door, with a Star of David painted on it, is ajar, the furnishings in disarray, the family gone. She asks passersby, runs to the police then on to the rail yard. Flashbacks show that Heinrich and the neighbors' son Paul are six years old and best friends. Paul's family's deportation is expected soon; Heinrich's mother tells her son that they're going to Toyland. Heinrich wants to go with them, has a bag packed, and listens for their departure. His mother realizes he's joined them, and her resolve becomes more urgent. Will she arrive in time to save Heinrich?", "genres": ["Short", "Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 1280548, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 1489}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:16:11.960000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "1942: what happens when a German kid believes that his Jewish neighbors are going to Toyland?
