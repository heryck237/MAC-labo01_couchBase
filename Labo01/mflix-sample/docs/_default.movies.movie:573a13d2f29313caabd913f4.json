Her father is summoned to her school and is told that his daughter may require counseling, but he refuses to believe and instead makes a donation to the school. Then Amrita meets with three males and a female, namely Zuben, Dushant Sahu, Karan Chaudhary; and Tanya Sharma respectively. Together they live it up with drugs and alcohol until things get out of control when they accidentally kill a couple. A corrupt police constable demands Rs.25 Lakhs to eliminate their involvement. Unable to come up with so much cash, the five decide to fake a kidnapping, demand the cash from Amrita's father, and clear their respective names. Amrita accordingly goes 'missing', and her father involves the police, who assign this case to once-suspended police inspector, Arvind Mathur. With the media getting involved, Arvind begins his investigation, but will soon find it hampered - complicating not only his assignment - but also his personal life.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1836912, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 4561}, "languages": ["Hindi", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:26:40.523000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Five substance-abusing friends decide to fake a kidnapping in order to bribe a police constable for covering-up a hit-and-run accident.", "released": 1307664000000, "runtime": 121, "title": "Shaitan", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439664972000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 118, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/cultofshaitan"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Abhijeet Deshpande (dialogue)", "K.S.
