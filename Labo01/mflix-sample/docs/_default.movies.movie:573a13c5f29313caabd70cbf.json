She's taken aback however when the local Sheriff tells her that her father put up their house as collateral for his bail and unless he shows up for his trial in a week's time, they will lose it all. She knows her father is involved in the local drug trade and manufactures crystal meth, but everywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it and stop poking your nose in other people's business. She refuses to listen, even after her father's brother, Teardrop, tells her he's probably been killed. She pushes on, putting her own life in danger, for the sake of her family until the truth, or enough of it, is revealed.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1399683, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 104504}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:41:28.763000000", "metacritic": 90, "plot": "An unflinching Ozark Mountain girl hacks through dangerous social terrain as she hunts down her drug-dealing father while trying to keep her family intact.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0OTM3MDMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY1MjI0Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1279238400000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Winter's Bone", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.5M", "consensus": "Bleak, haunting, and yet still somehow hopeful, Winter's Bone is writer-director Debra Granik's best work yet -- and it boasts an incredible, starmaking performance from Jennifer Lawrence.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 161, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 1288051200000, "fresh": 152, "lastUpdated": 1442081378000, "production": "Roadside Attractions", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 50071, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.wintersbonemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Debra Granik (screenplay)", "Anne Rosellini (screenplay)", "Daniel Woodrell (novel)"], "year": 2010}
