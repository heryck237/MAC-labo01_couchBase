There Alex meets his brother David, Lana (Alex's former lover and David's current wife), and Eva, Alex's 10-years-old niece. Looking for inspiration, Alex asks Eva to be the muse of the new robot, watching her attitude and behavior during the time they spend together, making emotional tests to configure its personality. The relationship with his niece gives Alex doubts about finishing the project and awakens old feelings for Lana. At the same time he starts suspecting that perhaps the lovely and imaginative Eva is hiding an important secret about Lana and herself.", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 1298554, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 6778}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 09:11:06.837000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A shy genius is employed by his former university to design robot software.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUwNjQyODAzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUxOTIwNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1426204800000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Eva", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$10.4k", "critic": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 5.8}, "fresh": 2, "lastUpdated": 1442511042000, "production": "The Weinstein Company", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 470, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.evalapelicula.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sergi Belbel", "Cristina Clemente (screenplay)", "Mart\u00e8 Roca (screenplay)", "Aintza Serra (screenplay)"], "year": 2011}
