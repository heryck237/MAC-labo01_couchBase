But more challenges arise for our young hero. Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against Peter; taking up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must also capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman. All hope seems lost when suddenly Peter's suit turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his powers. But it also begins to greatly amplify the much darker qualities of Peter's personality that he begins to lose himself to. Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "imdb": {"id": 413300, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 343455}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:02:25.170000000", "metacritic": 59, "num_mflix_comments": 399, "plot": "A strange black entity from another world bonds with Peter Parker and causes inner turmoil as he contends with new villains, temptations, and revenge.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MDljOWQtNGI2My00OTEzLTlhYjQtOTQ4ODM2MzUwY2IwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1178236800000, "runtime": 139, "title": "Spider-Man 3", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$336.5M", "consensus": "Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 246, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1193702400000, "fresh": 154, "lastUpdated": 1442080852000, "production": "Sony Pictures", "rotten": 92, "viewer": {"meter": 51, "numReviews": 2261791, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/spiderman3/site/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sam Raimi (screenplay)", "Ivan Raimi (screenplay)", "Alvin Sargent (screenplay)", "Sam Raimi (screen story)", "Ivan Raimi (screen story)", "Stan Lee (Marvel comic book)", "Steve Ditko (Marvel comic book)"], "year": 2007}
