Flashback to 1941, he's living with his brother in a tiny apartment in New York City, drinking too much, and exhibiting an occasional painting in group shows. That's when he meets artist Lee Krasner, who puts her career on hold to be his companion, lover, champion, wife, and, in essence, caretaker. To get him away from booze, insecurity, and the stress of city life, they move to the Hamptons where nature and sobriety help Pollock achieve a breakthrough in style: a critic praises, then Life magazine calls. But so do old demons: the end is nasty, brutish, and short.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 183659, "rating": 7, "votes": 21890}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:00:18.963000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A film about the life and career of the American painter, Jackson Pollock.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU0NjJkNGQtOGY0ZS00MTEyLTk4NDEtODA5MTc4NGY1NjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 985305600000, "runtime": 122, "title": "Pollock", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$7.3M", "consensus": "Though Pollock does not really allow audiences a glimpse of the painter as a person, it does powerfully depict the creative process.
