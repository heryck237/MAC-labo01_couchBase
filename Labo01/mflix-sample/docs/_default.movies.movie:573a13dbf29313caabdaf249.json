Tweedy American doctor, Ted Fielding, (Will Forte) arrives in Ireland to stay with them for two months: his research grant providing the Caseys with essential financial aid. Vanetia's a dynamo. But with two young kids and both men in the house, she's feeling bombarded and initially treats Ted and his study of Conor with resistance. Only when she observes Ted's calming influence on the family does she begin to value his friendship, and, in return, Ted enjoys their heady, happy-go-lucky world. But Ted's continued presence in the house sets the family on course for an emotional collision. Directed by Academy Award\u00e8-nominee Steph Green and featuring Saturday Night Live star Will Forte in an impressive dramatic debut, this life-affirming film embraces the healing power of love and family in all of its idiosyncratic forms. Run and Jump is an unexpected, unconventional romance, intimate family portrait and emotional journey of recovery.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2343158, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 947}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:40:06.767000000", "metacritic": 71, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An American doctor travels to Ireland to study the Casey family after 38-year-old Conor suffers a stroke which changes his personality, leaving dynamo wife and mother Vanetia to run the show.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDk1NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA5OTIyMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1390521600000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Run & Jump", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$8.2k", "critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 35, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1401148800000, "fresh": 31, "lastUpdated": 1442337050000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 1792, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.ifcfilms.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steph Green", "Ailbhe Keogan"], "year": 2013}
