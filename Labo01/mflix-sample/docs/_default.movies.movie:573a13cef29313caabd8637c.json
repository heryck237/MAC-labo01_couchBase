Along with projecting his own faults onto his father, his own jealousy for lack of success and accomplishment onto his younger brother, and wallowing in the blind support of his mother, it's just another aspect of Abe's unsatisfying life that he just can't see to improve. A long-overdue decision finally spins his insignificant life out of control.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1690455, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 4004}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:41:27.660000000", "metacritic": 66, "plot": "Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who is the dark horse of his family and a depressed woman on the rebound.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5MDNjMDgtYjRlNy00ZGEyLWI3OTItZWIxYTcyY2FhNGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1340928000000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Dark Horse", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.2M", "consensus": "Typically misanthropic yet curiously satisfying and incisive, Dark Horse is a movie that preaches to the cynical converted.", "critic": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 71, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1352764800000, "fresh": 50, "lastUpdated": 1442510644000, "production": "Vitagraph Films", "rotten": 21, "viewer": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 3367, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://www.darkhorsemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Todd Solondz"], "year": 2011}
