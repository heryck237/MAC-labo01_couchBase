The story takes place right now, next door. Gili is a teenager who decides to change schools. She is determined to improve her lame social status. Over the course of a few weeks she hooks up with several different boys, all from her new school. Their encounters get more and more sexual. Exploring their limits each time further. The boys are eager to take what is so generously offered, and Gilli is thrilled to get the attention. No tears, no complaints, no consequences. No adults.
