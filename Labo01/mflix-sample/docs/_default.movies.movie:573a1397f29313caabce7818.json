One hundred years ago, the wealthy leper Blake bought the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane and sailed with his people to form a leper colony. However, while sailing through a thick fog, they were deliberately misguided by a campfire onshore, steering the course of the ship toward the light and crashing her against the rocks. While the townsfolk prepare to celebrate, the victims of this heinous crime that the town's founding fathers committed rise from the sea to claim retribution. Under cover of the fog, they carry out their vicious attacks, searching for what is rightly theirs.", "genres": ["Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 80749, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 42300}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 00:30:55.913000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Legend says that Antonio Bay was built in 1880 with blood money obtained from shipwrecked lepers but no one believes it.
