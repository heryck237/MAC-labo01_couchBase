But in humorous contrast to their staid, passionless lives, characters in a constant state of sexual arousal surround them. Their libidinous teen son, whose hilarious voiceover commentary intermittently provides important narrative information, prides himself on being the high school stud and aspires to a career in porn. Gabriela's sexy employee switches boyfriends the way she changes clothes. And despite being married, Gabriel's colleague is working his way through the female members of their orchestra. Ultimately, the two Gabys find their virtual affairs reconnect them with their own desires, but in a way less movie-fantasy and more satisfyingly real-life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1670627, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1215}, "languages": ["Romanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:37:04.403000000", "plot": "Musician Gabriel and dimpled dry-cleaning proprietress Gabriela live like two strangers who no longer see each other.
