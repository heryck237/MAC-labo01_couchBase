As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.", "genres": ["Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 1125849, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 240735}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:21:06.963000000", "metacritic": 81, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A faded professional wrestler must retire, but finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjYyOTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc2MzQwMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1233273600000, "runtime": 109, "title": "The Wrestler", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$26.1M", "consensus": "Mickey Rourke gives a performance for the ages in The Wrestler, a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 218, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1240272000000, "fresh": 214, "lastUpdated": 1442163642000, "production": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 138272, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.thewrestlermovie.com/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert D.
