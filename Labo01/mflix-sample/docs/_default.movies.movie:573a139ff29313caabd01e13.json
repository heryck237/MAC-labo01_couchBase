This starts Tina on a career taking her from Canada to Paris to Montr\u00e8al again, to Manhattan, to the world, and then home, through two boyfriends, two husbands, and innumerable TV interviews, either with nasty smiling scandalmongers or with gushing witless twits. In nearly every case, Tina never gets to finish a sentence. She has a suave agent, paparazzi are everywhere (\"What the celebs forget, there's always a camera,\" says one), and a documentary filmmaker is on hand as well. What is it that Tina thinks, feels, and wants: will we ever find out?", "genres": ["Drama", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 192949, "rating": 5.7, "votes": 1481}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-04 01:15:32.693000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young girl is plucked from small-town obscurity and thrust into the spotlight of the glamorous world of super-models.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMjQ0MzYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyNTEzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 971395200000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Stardom", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 43, "numReviews": 23, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 1001376000000, "fresh": 10, "lastUpdated": 1439144827000, "production": "Lions Gate Releasing", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 41, "numReviews": 1517, "rating": 2.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Denys Arcand", "Jacob Potashnik"], "year": 2000}
