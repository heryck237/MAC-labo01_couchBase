Turner (1775-1851). Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies. Throughout this, he travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits brothels, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 2473794, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 13682}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:39:14.857000000", "metacritic": 94, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An exploration of the last quarter century of the great, if eccentric, British painter J.M.W.
