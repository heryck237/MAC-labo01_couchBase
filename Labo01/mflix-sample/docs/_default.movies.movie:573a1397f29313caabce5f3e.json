Former minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker is a lazy, beer swilling swimming pool cleaner who takes money to coach the Bears, a bunch of disheveled misfits who have virtually no baseball talent. Realizing his dilemma, Coach Buttermaker brings aboard girl pitching ace Amanda Whurlizer, the daughter of a former girlfriend, and Kelly Leak, a motorcycle punk who happens to be the best player around. Brimming with confidence, the Bears look to sweep into the championship game and avenge an earlier loss to their nemesis, the Yankees.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 74174, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 15428}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 03:33:53.130000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An aging, down-on-his-luck ex-minor leaguer coaches a team of misfits in an ultra-competitive California little league.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU1ZjNmNjktNjk4Yy00MzdjLTk0YzktMDRlYTllMjE0N2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 197683200000, "runtime": 102, "title": "The Bad News Bears", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The Bad News Bears is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau.", "critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 26, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 1013472000000, "fresh": 25, "lastUpdated": 1439921542000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 40071, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Lancaster"], "year": 1976}
