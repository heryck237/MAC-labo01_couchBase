From the nail-biting freshman auditions to the spectacular year-end performances, Fame High captures the in-class and at-home drama, competition, heartbreak, and triumph during one school year at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA), also known as Fame High. Talented teenagers reach for their dreams of becoming actors, singers, dancers, and musicians. LACHSA is one of the most respected and competitive public arts high schools in the country.

In a time when performance-based entertainment is commonplace, it is safe to call Fame High the facts behind the fiction.
