Facing a crisis of conscience, Ellsberg becomes convinced that the American people have not been told the truth about the war, its justifications, or its likely outcome. He decides to expose the secret history of the war in hopes that the American public, its eyes opened, will force the government to end the war. In order to do so, he must risk his career and his freedom, perhaps even his life.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 330760, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 1152}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 01:19:22.827000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Defense worker Daniel Ellsberg seeks to publish a series of classified government documents detailing the true nature of America's involvement in the Vietnam War.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIzNzYwMDI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY3MTUyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1047168000000, "runtime": 92, "title": "The Pentagon Papers", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1076976000000, "lastUpdated": 1438716592000, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 529, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jason Horwitch"], "year": 2003}
