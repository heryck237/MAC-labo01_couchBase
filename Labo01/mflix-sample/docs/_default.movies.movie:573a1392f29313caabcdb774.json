Once the train departs, the one person who it is uncertain is on the train is a middle aged English governess named Miss Froy. Iris Henderson, who was vacationing in Mandrika with girlfriends before heading back to England to get married, is certain that Miss Froy was on the train as they were in the same compartment and they had tea together in the dining car, but all those people who can corroborate her story don't seem to want to do so. Iris' thoughts are easily dismissed as a possible concussion as Iris was hit over the head just before boarding the train. Iris will take anyone's help in finding Miss Froy, even that of an Englishman named Gilbert, a musicologist with who she had a not so pleasant encounter at the inn the evening before. As Iris and Gilbert go on their quest throughout the train, they believe there is a conspiracy amongst many of the passengers against the validity of there being a Miss Froy. But if there is a conspiracy, Iris and Gilbert still have to find Miss Froy and find out why anyone would want to kidnap a middle aged English governess.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 30341, "rating": 8, "votes": 33752}, "languages": ["English", "German", "French", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:02:33.090000000", "plot": "While traveling in continental Europe, a rich young playgirl realizes that an elderly lady seems to have disappeared from the train.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk3YzFjYTktOGY0ZS00Y2EwLTk2NTctYTI1Nzc2OWNiN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MTUwNTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -983577600000, "runtime": 96, "title": "The Lady Vanishes", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "One of Alfred Hitchcock's last British films, this glamorous thriller provides an early glimpse of the director at his most stylishly entertaining.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 40, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 973728000000, "fresh": 39, "lastUpdated": 1440096810000, "production": "Gaumont British Picture Corporation", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 12559, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.criterion.com/films/358-the-lady-vanishes"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ethel Lina White (based upon the story: \"The Wheel Spins\" by)", "Sidney Gilliat (screen play)", "Frank Launder (screen play)"], "year": 1938}
