Indigenous peoples apply body paint; whole villages dance. The film moves to destruction of nature via logging, blasting, and strip mining. Images of poverty, rapid urban life, and factories give way to war, concentration camps, and mass graves. Ancient ruins come into view, and then a sacred river where pilgrims bathe and funeral pyres burn. Prayer and nature return. A monk rings a huge bell; stars wheel across the sky.", "genres": ["Documentary", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 103767, "rating": 8.6, "votes": 25314}, "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 01:02:32.597000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A collection of expertly photographed scenes of human life and religion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1Njc1NzctMTQxYy00ZDc0LWEzOTYtNmMyYjJjMWQ4MWJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 752112000000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Baraka", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 25, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 948758400000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1441046813000, "production": "Magidson Films", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 21413, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ron Fricke (concept)", "Mark Magidson (concept)", "Ron Fricke (scenario)", "Mark Magidson (scenario)", "Genevieve Nicholas (treatment)", "Constantine Nicholas (treatment)", "Ron Fricke (treatment)", "Bob Green (concept)", "Bob Green (scenario)"], "year": 1992}
