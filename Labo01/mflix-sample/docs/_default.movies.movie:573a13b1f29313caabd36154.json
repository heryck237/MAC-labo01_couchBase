David is a widower grieving for two years. He writes science fiction and was considered weird as a boy. He meets Dennis, a foster child who claims to be on a mission from Mars, stays in a large box all day, fears sunlight, and wears a belt of flashlight batteries so he won't float away. David takes the six-year-old home on a trial. His sister and his wife's best friend offer support, but the guys are basically alone to figure this out. Dennis takes things, is expelled, and is coached by David in being normal. Will the court approve the adoption, and will Dennis stay? Can a man become a father and a child become a son?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 415965, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 16786}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:02:54.453000000", "metacritic": 48, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A science-fiction writer, recently widowed, considers whether to adopt a hyper-imaginative 6-year-old abandoned and socially rejected boy who says he's really from Mars.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMDAxNzYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3MDU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1193961600000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Martian Child", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$7.5M", "consensus": "Despite some charms, overt emotional manipulation and an inconsistent tone prevents Martian Child from being the heartfelt dramedy it aspires to be.", "critic": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 106, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1202860800000, "fresh": 35, "lastUpdated": 1440613191000, "production": "New Line Cinema", "rotten": 71, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 84469, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.martianchild.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Seth Bass (screenplay)", "Jonathan Tolins (screenplay)", "David Gerrold (novel)"], "year": 2007}
