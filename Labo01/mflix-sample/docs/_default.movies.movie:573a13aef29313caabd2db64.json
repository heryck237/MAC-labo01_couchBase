This film tells the story of Hollywood's approach to the subject, starting with its initial pre-war reluctance to alienate the lucrative German market. With World War II, and the discovery of the Nazi horrors, we follow Hollywood's reaction over the decades to the atrocity. Challenged with a tragedy that beggared the imagination of artists and audiences, Hollywood grew from trying to keep it in the abstract to striving to depict it head-on in ways that would be both truthful and respectful with the proper humanity.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 379158, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 555}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:35:45.423000000", "plot": "The history of Hollywood's handling of the Nazis and its later depiction of the Holocaust they perpetrated.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMTMwOTEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUzNTkyMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1198540800000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust", "type": "movie", "year": 2004}
