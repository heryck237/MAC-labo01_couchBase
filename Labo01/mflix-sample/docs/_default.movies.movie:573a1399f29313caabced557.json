The artist's work has never represented the sun's rays between the leaves of the tree, and, given his characteristic realist style, he tries to achieve this. But he goes about it in the same way, without consciously pursuing a finished picture - he just wants to be close to the fragile lavish tree for a few weeks.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 105438, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1118}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:25:18.773000000", "metacritic": 82, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The artist, Antonio Lopez, tries to paint the quince tree he planted some time back in his garden.
