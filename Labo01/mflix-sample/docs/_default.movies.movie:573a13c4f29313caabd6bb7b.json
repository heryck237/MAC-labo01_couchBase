Along the journey, we see archival footage of rehearsals, performances, and private moments including a Miami concert resulting in Morrison's arrest and trial for indecency. His love of the spotlight, his desire to be a poet, and his alcohol-fueled mood swings lead to a back and forth between public and private desires, successes, and failures. The band's music plays throughout.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 1333667, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 6547}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:45:07.593000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "A look at the late '60s and early '70s rock band The Doors, including rare exclusive footage.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjQ3OTQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5NTgyMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1273622400000, "runtime": 86, "title": "The Doors: When You're Strange", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "It's far from a critical assessment of the band's music or its legacy, but When You're Strange gives fans a beautifully filmed, lovingly assembled tribute to the Doors.", "critic": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 68, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1277769600000, "fresh": 42, "lastUpdated": 1442256783000, "production": "Rhino Entertainment Co.", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 5813, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://whenyourestrangemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tom DiCillo"], "year": 2009}
