As scientist Nathan trains the wild man, Puff, in the ways of the world - starting with table manners - Nathan's lover Lila fights to preserve the man's simian past, which represents a freedom enviable to most. In the power struggle that ensues, an unusual love triangle emerges exposing the perversities of the human heart and the idiosyncrasies of the civilized mind. Human Nature is a comical examination of the trappings of desire in a world where both nature and culture are idealized.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 219822, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 14870}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:19:50.640000000", "metacritic": 56, "plot": "A woman is in love with a man in love with another woman, and all three have designs on a young man raised as an ape.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FiNzM1NzgtYzJmYi00NzRjLWFmYzktMzI1M2FlMWYzYjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1018569600000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Human Nature", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.7M", "consensus": "As quirky as Being John Malkovich but not as funny, Human Nature feels too forced and unengaging.", "critic": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 94, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1039478400000, "fresh": 46, "lastUpdated": 1442078930000, "production": "Fine Line Features", "rotten": 48, "viewer": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 12346, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.humannaturemovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Charlie Kaufman"], "year": 2001}
