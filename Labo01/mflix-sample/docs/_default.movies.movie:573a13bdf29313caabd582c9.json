The immediate concern is the fate of the British Expeditionary Force now trapped with their back to the sea. The evacuation at Dunquerque saved most of them. Churchill formed a unified government with the Labour party and was steadfast in refusing to negotiate with the Germans. He developed a personal relationship with U.S. President Roosevelt but England (as Churchill always referred to the UK) stood alone until the U.S. entered the war. By war's end however, Labour won the election and Churchill was out of office.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 992993, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 2927}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:55:04.550000000", "plot": "Continuing the storyline of The Gathering Storm, Churchill at War is a look at the former British prime minister's life and career at the end of WWII.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2YjI4NjktNzVhMi00ZTBkLTgzN2QtYzEyNTYyMjg4ZGVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjExMjk0ODk@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-PG", "released": 1243728000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Into the Storm", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1259625600000, "lastUpdated": 1437934165000, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 649, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.hbo.com/movies/into-the-storm#/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hugh Whitemore"], "year": 2009}
