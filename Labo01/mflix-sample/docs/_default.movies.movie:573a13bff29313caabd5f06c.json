He's in an unknown location, sedated, while various Chinese are harvesting his organs. His heart is gone, in an ice chest; a temporary in its place. Chev escapes, knowing only the name of the guy with the ice chest. He calls Doc Miles, an unlicensed cardiologist, who tells him there's only an hour's life in the artificial heart: keep it charged. Chev needs to find his own heart and get to Doc for a transplant. He starts his time-limited pursuit of shadowy figures, the ice chest, and his heart aided by Eve, Rei, and Venus - a stripper, a prostitute, and a pal with Tourette's - constantly needing an electric charge to keep going.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1121931, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 102124}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:39:16.883000000", "metacritic": 41, "plot": "Chelios faces a Chinese mobster who has stolen his nearly indestructible heart and replaced it with a battery-powered ticker that requires regular jolts of electricity to keep working.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNTU1ODkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgyODEzMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1239926400000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Crank: High Voltage", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$13.6M", "consensus": "Crank: High Voltage delivers on its promises: a fast-paced, exciting thrill ride that doesn't take itself too seriously.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 67, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1252368000000, "fresh": 42, "lastUpdated": 1442138314000, "production": "Lionsgate", "rotten": 25, "viewer": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 256776, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.crank2.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Neveldine", "Brian Taylor"], "year": 2009}
