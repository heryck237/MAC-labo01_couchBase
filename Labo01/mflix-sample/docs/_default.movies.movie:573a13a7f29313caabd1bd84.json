Hart"], "countries": ["USA"], "directors": ["Bill Morrison"], "fullplot": "Black and white stock footage, much of it scratched or blistered, illustrates a Michael Gordon symphony. A whirling dervish, couples laughing, a soldier trying to take advantage of a flower vendor, a camel caravan moving across the horizon, a single plane and then others, paratroopers in the sky, a mining disaster, a pugilist, nuns and children at a school - some images last a few seconds, others for a minute or more. The scratches, blisters, and bygone look of the footage suggest time's passage. Only the dervish, who begins and ends the film, is intact.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 303325, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 596}, "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:12:00.157000000", "metacritic": 67, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A meditation on the human quest to transcend physicality, constructed from decaying archival footage and set to an original symphonic score.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNTU1NTk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI0MDI1OQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1065139200000, "runtime": 70, "title": "Decasia", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1075161600000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1441994956000, "production": "Plexifilm", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 625, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.decasia.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Morrison"], "year": 2002}
