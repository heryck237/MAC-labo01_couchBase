Director Byron Hurt, former star college quarterback, longtime hip-hop fan, and gender violence prevention educator, conceived the documentary as a \"loving critique\" of a number of disturbing trends in the world of rap music. He pays tribute to hip-hop while challenging the rap music industry to take responsibility for glamorizing destructive, deeply conservative stereotypes of manhood. The documentary features revealing interviews about masculinity and sexism with rappers such as Mos Def, Fat Joe, Chuck D, Jadakiss, and Busta Rhymes, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, and cultural commentators such as Michael Eric Dyson and Beverly Guy-Shetfall. Critically acclaimed for its fearless engagement with issues of race, gender violence, and the corporate exploitation of youth culture.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 976039, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 225}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-05 00:42:12.280000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes provides a riveting examination of manhood, sexism, and homophobia in hip-hop culture.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMjA5ODU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE1OTY0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1136073600000, "runtime": 61, "title": "Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437415912000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 395, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Byron Hurt"], "year": 2006}
