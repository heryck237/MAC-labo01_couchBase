Pedophile priests, especially Father John Geoghan, were sexually molesting young boys. Although the Cardinal at the time, Bernard Law, was made aware of the evil acts committed by Geoghan & other priests, he sided with the priests and quietly moved them from one church to the next, and kept the matter a secret from the authorities. Years later, the victims start to come forward, and a lawyer sues Cardinal Law & the diocese for hiding the crimes from the authorities. Cardinal Law arrogantly defends his behavior, and refuses to resign. Meanwhile, Father Geoghan is found guilty and sentenced to 10 years behind bars. Will the Cardinal resign now...or continue to try to hold onto his position?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 421108, "rating": 7, "votes": 461}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:59:31.627000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A dramatized account of the hidden sexual abuse and scandal that shook the foundation of the Catholic Church, and the characters, events, and policies that brought the abuse and scandal into existence.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODE0OTIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjczMjkyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1116633600000, "runtime": 130, "title": "Our Fathers", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1139270400000, "lastUpdated": 1441135857000, "production": "Showtime Networks Inc.", "viewer": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 550, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.sho.com/site/schedules/product_page.do?episodeid=123687&seriesid=0"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David France (book)", "Thomas Michael Donnelly (screenplay)"], "year": 2005}
