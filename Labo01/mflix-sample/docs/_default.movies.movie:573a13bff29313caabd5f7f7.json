He's told that if his train strikes and kills one more person this month, he'll get a large severance, enough for the cottage. So he offers \u00e81500 to Tommy Cassidy, a down-and-out Irishman, if Tommy will walk in front of Paul's train come Monday. He gives Tommy the cash on Friday. Wanting to ensure that Tommy honors the deal, Paul accompanies a cleaned-up Tommy on his trip (in a new suit and a hired car) to make things right with family he hasn't seen in eight years. Can Tommy, an inveterate gambler, make anything come out right? And what about Paul - can this suicide pact fulfill his dreams?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1130980, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 1724}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 01:14:02.173000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A comedy about ordinary people with unique dilemmas.
