The film shows Erica coming to terms with the break-up while revising her opinions of herself, redefining that self in its own right rather than as an extension of somebody else's personality, and finally going out with another man. Erica refuses to drop everything for Saul, an abstract expressionist painter, simply out of love for him because he expects her to. It is not so much loneliness that is her problem, and the problems that men, flitting around this newly \"available\" woman like moths round a flame, bring to her sense of independence.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 78444, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3067}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:44:49.883000000", "plot": "A wealthy woman from Manhattan's Upper East Side struggles to deal with her new identity and her sexuality after her husband of 16 years leaves her for a younger woman.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNhNzU5OGItZDk5Zi00NjJlLTkzMGMtZDNmNjQ5ZjZjZjRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 264988800000, "runtime": 124, "title": "An Unmarried Woman", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 17, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1136851200000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1442434624000, "production": "20th Century Fox Film Corporation", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 1732, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Mazursky"], "year": 1978}
