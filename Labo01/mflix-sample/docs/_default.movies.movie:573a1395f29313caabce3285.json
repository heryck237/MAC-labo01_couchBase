He displaces his hostility by brutally flogging her horse and she retaliates by humiliating him before a houseful of guests, repeatedly slashing him across the face with her riding crop. She is also committing adultery with the officer next door, who's wife cut off her nipples with garden shears after the death of her baby. She has sought solace in the ministrations of her effeminate houseboy. The sixth character, coveted by the major, is a darkly handsome noncom, a voyeur and lingerie-fondler, given to nightly appearances as a peeping tom in the birdbrain's bedroom and daily sessions of horseback riding in the middle of the woods stark naked.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 62185, "rating": 7, "votes": 4172}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:32:11.520000000", "plot": "Bizarre tale of sex, betrayal, and perversion at a military post.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNiMDA1YWQtZmI0NC00ODEwLTg5NDctOThjN2IyZGZlNWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -70070400000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Reflections in a Golden Eye", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1162857600000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1441044079000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 1294, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Chapman Mortimer (screenplay)", "Gladys Hill (screenplay)", "Carson McCullers (novel)"], "year": 1967}
