While the second child is brought up by upper caste, Kasturi and Govind, performs poojas at a variety of weddings and funerals, and is in love with Chandrakala. Chaos will enter their lives when Narsingh will be abducted by a gangster, Baba Bhai, and held until and unless his biological father, an Indian Army Major, reveals a secret.
