He's egotistical, a famous writer and publisher with an attractive wife little older than Lolita. She's in a choir, rehearsing for a concert; she's given her father a tape, which he's yet to listen to. Sylvia, a voice coach, is willing to help the group, knowing she'll have a chance to get her husband's new novel in front of Lolita's father. For Lolita, this is a pattern: people pay attention to her to gain access to him, something she fears is the intent of S\u00e8bastien, a struggling journalist who may become her boyfriend. The night of the concert, the music may bring out everyone's feelings.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 374583, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 4636}, "languages": ["French", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:38:48.167000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A french girl gifted with a great voice, has a complex about her weight and her appearance.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjcwODQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUxNzgyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1116547200000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Look at Me", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Agn\u00e8s Jaoui (scenario)", "Jean-Pierre Bacri (scenario)"], "year": 2004}
