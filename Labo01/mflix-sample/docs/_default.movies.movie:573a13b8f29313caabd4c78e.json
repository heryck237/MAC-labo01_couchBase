Their symbolic quest, which takes them from endless two lane highways to small idyllic towns to the arid desert, finds Daft Punk once again resisting conformity and developing new ways to highlight their inventive vision. A silent feature-length film that made its international debut at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, Electroma will interest Daft Punk fans and film enthusiasts alike. With its breathtaking cinematography, innovative filming techniques, and above all its underlying search for humanity within a dystopian environment, Daft Punk have delivered a film that finds a common thread with their previous work while exploring new horizons as directors of their first feature film.", "genres": ["Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 800022, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 3052}, "lastupdated": "2015-07-12 00:33:45.047000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Follows the history of two robots, the members of Daft Punk, on their quest to become human.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcyMTE2NTQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyMjY0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1174694400000, "runtime": 74, "title": "Daft Punk's Electroma", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1216684800000, "lastUpdated": 1439491417000, "production": "Daft Arts", "viewer": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 3798, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thomas Bangalter", "Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo", "C\u00e8dric Hervet", "Paul Hahn"], "year": 2006}
