Editor Michal Leszczylowski took the material and added scenes of previous interviews and interesting statements from the script of Offret and from Tarkovsky's book 'Sculpting in Time'. The result is a documentary that shows the way Tarkovksy worked: carefully building each scene. Shows why he did the things he did: his vision on film. And shows the emotion of the man Tarkovsky: his great disappointment when the camera breaks while shooting the house going up in flames.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 95967, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 358}, "languages": ["Swedish", "Russian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-04-27 08:43:39.967000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Documentary on the making of \"The Sacrifice.\"", "released": 590976000000, "runtime": 102, "title": "Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437070048000, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 229, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Michal Leszczylowski"], "year": 1988}
