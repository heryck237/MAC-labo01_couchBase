What begins as friendship quickly blossoms into something deeper. Peyton tries to extricate herself before her heart wants what it can't have. Elena can't imagine not having Peyton in her life. And despite the fact that she has never even considered kissing a woman, Elena is overwhelmed with a desire to do just that. Despite Peyton's reservations, Elena pushes the relationship into a full-blown affair.
