While riding his cycle to the next gig, an irate dad runs him off the road when he flirts with his daughter. He's forced to hook up with a traveling carnival until his bike can be fixed. The carnival is run by a tough old broad, a broken-down drunk and his nubile daughter. Along the way, Charlie (who's got a chip on his shoulder about being an orphan) somehow learns about family values from this vaguely dysfunctional one. A scheming rival carny shows up, based on the legend of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's real-life manager.", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 58534, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 1771}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:02:38.497000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Charlie Rogers is a leather-jacketed biker who's fired from a singing engagement after getting into a fight with a group of college toughs.
