Macreedy steps off the train in Black Rock, he feels a chill from the local residents. The town is only a speck on the map and few if any strangers ever come to the place. Macreedy himself is tight-lipped about the purpose of his trip and he finds that the hotel refuses him a room, the local garage refuses to rent him a car and the sheriff is a useless drunkard. It's apparent that the locals have something to hide but when he finally tells them that he is there to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Kamoko, he touches a nerve so sensitive that he will spend the next 24 hours fighting for his life.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Film-Noir"], "imdb": {"id": 47849, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 13332}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:24:58.577000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A one handed stranger comes to a tiny town possessing a terrible past they want to keep secret, by violent means if necessary.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNDcyNmEtNGJhMS00M2Y2LTgxYTEtMzM3NjljNDEyOGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -472867200000, "runtime": 81, "title": "Bad Day at Black Rock", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 97, "numReviews": 29, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1115683200000, "fresh": 28, "lastUpdated": 1442083850000, "production": "MGM Home Entertainment", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 5656, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Millard Kaufman (screen play)", "Don McGuire (adaptation)", "Howard Breslin (based on a story by)"], "year": 1955}
