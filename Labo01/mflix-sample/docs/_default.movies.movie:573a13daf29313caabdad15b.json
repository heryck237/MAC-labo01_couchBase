Tattooed and hiding behind a tough exterior, he instantly clashes with his fellow inmates. This brings him to the attention of Rose, an elderly volunteer who mentors some of the boys. Rose has a unique style that is tough, wise, and unpredictable. Sensing something special in him, she offers an outrageous proposal to Grantham. She wants him to accompany her on a journey, the purpose of which she won't reveal. She is able and willing to spring him if he agrees. At first he thinks she is crazy, but Rose is crazy like a fox. She sneaks him out under everyone's noses and off they go. This is a charming and unexpected twist on that pillar of American cinema: the road trip. These are two people meant to clash ferociously, as well as to change each other in ways they could never anticipate.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 2311948, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 39}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:09:38.360000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Seventeen-year-old Grantham struggles to find his way as a man when a spontaneous road trip thrusts him into the care of a feisty eighty-one-year-old African-American woman named Rose.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mzc5MTQxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM0Njg5MzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "runtime": 90, "title": "Grantham & Rose", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440182088000, "production": "ClubNano Films", "viewer": {"numReviews": 14, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.granthamandrose.com/Grantham_and_Rose/Premiers_March_23,_2014.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ryan Spahn"], "year": 2014}
