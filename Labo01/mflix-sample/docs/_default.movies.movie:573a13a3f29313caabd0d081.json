After a minor car crash, the headstrong Judah and other Jewish youths who patrol as vigilantes confront Scratch, a mouthy African-American hustler. Passengers in the cars make eye contact: Sol, a hip-hop musician, songwriter, and artist (Scratch's friend), and Sara, who is betrothed to Judah but wants to go to college and be on her own. Over the next few days, while Scratch and Judah's conflict escalates in violence, Sara and Sol connect in ways that echo Sheba and Solomon. The friendship puts them in danger.", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 240389, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 267}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:46:16.837000000", "metacritic": 26, "plot": "A charismatic rapper falls in love with a young Jewish girl despite the confines of her religious background.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDQ3NTIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU4MTcyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 998006400000, "runtime": 89, "title": "Brooklyn Babylon", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 6, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 990489600000, "fresh": 3, "lastUpdated": 1442168108000, "production": "Artisan Entertainment", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 588, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marc Levin", "Bonz Malone", "Pam Widener"], "year": 2001}
