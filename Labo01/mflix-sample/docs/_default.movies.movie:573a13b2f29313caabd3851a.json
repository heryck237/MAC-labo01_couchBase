He visits her body, placing a photograph of their pet rabbit on her hands. Then, in the early morning light, he leaves and catches a train back home toward Dublin. He sits across from a young talkative man who seems to have a loose screw, making coarse observations, starting an argument with a couple in the next seats who are clearly tense with each other. Over the next few miles, Donnelly learns that all four have lost someone that night, and, in a strange turn of events, the kid bequeaths to Donnelly a gift that may ease his pain. There's a strange bond in grief.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Short"], "imdb": {"id": 425458, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 5920}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:22:08.260000000", "plot": "A black and bloody Irish comedy about a sad train journey where an older man, whose wife has died that morning, encounters a strange and possibly psychotic young oddball....", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTBkMThhNDktYjQwMi00ODYyLTk1NTktMTkyMzYyYjY0ZTM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjExNjgyMTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1107216000000, "runtime": 27, "title": "Six Shooter", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442081661000, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 736, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Martin McDonagh"], "year": 2004}
