He gave his word to the worried partner that he would never enter into the printing business again as competition! Phalke got instantly unemployed and workless. The family was struggling to survive. One day he accidentally stumbled across a tent theatre that was screening a silent motion picture. He was awestruck with the film. The idea of film making struck him. Along with his hardworking wife and two enthusiastic kids by his side, he ventured into a field unknown to contemporary India. Making of India's first feature film, 'Raja Harishchandra' was an amazing adventure. The Phalke family encountered mostly funny but also a few grave situations during their journey of film making. They were a team of crazy yet lovable people that helped in winning over patrons and eventually money. Together, not only did they deliver the first Indian film, but they had ensured it to become the first super hit film too! In 1914, Phalke refused offers from his English friends to make films in London. His reason for the refusal was - 'I must keep making films in India, so that it gets established as an industry at home'.
