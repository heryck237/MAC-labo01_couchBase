With regard to their musical prowess, they have always had a friendly competitive nature with each other, fueled in large part by the want of their pianist mother, Iris, for them to achieve musical greatness. But underlying this friendliness is a deep desire to be truly better than the other. Despite or perhaps in part because of her flamboyant performance style, the younger Jackie emerges from the shadows of older Hilary's more triumphant childhood successes to become the renowned musician in the family. Although both continue with their music and both end up marrying (Hilary to Kiffer Finzi, and Jackie to pianist Daniel Barenboim), Hilary focuses on her home life, whereas Jackie focuses on her career. A seemingly odd request by Jackie to Hilary is later understood, but Hilary's agreement to that request demonstrates the true nature of their loving but unusual sisterly relationship.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 150915, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 8418}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:17:57.043000000", "metacritic": 78, "plot": "The tragic story of world renowned classic cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e8, as told from the point of view of her sister, flautist Hilary du Pr\u00e8-Finzi.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMTQxNzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgzMzMyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 916358400000, "runtime": 121, "title": "Hilary and Jackie", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Brilliant performances, lush cinematography, and complex storytelling deserve audience's attention.", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 57, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 932428800000, "fresh": 49, "lastUpdated": 1441904956000, "production": "October Films", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 6483, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hilary du Pr\u00e8 (book)", "Piers du Pr\u00e8 (book)", "Frank Cottrell Boyce (screenplay)"], "year": 1998}
