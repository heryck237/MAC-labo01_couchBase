What's going on? She's Sherry McGrale, a singer building a reputation on college campuses, especially for her signature song about having been raped. A rock magazine in L.A. takes notice, and writer Owen Richardson recognizes her: his older brother orchestrated the assault and involved him. Owen heads for Florida, ostensibly to do a piece on her, but in reality to try to put his own demons to rest. Wounds from the event are ruining Sherry and Owen's current relationships. Is there any prospect of healing? A judge, Sherry's manager, and a widow with young kids provide supporting arms.", "genres": ["Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 245501, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1130}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-02 00:09:06.170000000", "plot": "A young music journalist's dark memories are awakened when he goes to interview a female rock singer, and both are forced to confront troubling secrets from their pasts.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNGY4NGUtOGZhNi00ZmY1LWEyNjItYzIzMjRmYTRhMGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 980294400000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Things Behind the Sun", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1049760000000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1436725571000, "production": "Behind the Sun Productions", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 1016, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Allison Anders", "Kurt Voss"], "year": 2001}
