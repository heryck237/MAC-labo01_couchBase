In a multi story narrative, we peer behind the closed doors of a seemingly normal suburban street. A woman with a dangerous fantasy and her partners struggle to please her. A man who begins an affair with his own wife without her knowing anything about it. A couple struggling to keep things together after a sexual experiment spins out of control. A woman who can only find pleasure in her husband's pain. A call centre operator caught in the middle of a dirty and chaotic phone call. And the distractingly charming new neighbour who connects them all. The little Death explores why do we want what we want? How far will we go to get it? What are the consequences of that fleeting moment of sexual ecstasy?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 2785032, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 14085}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:46:59.450000000", "metacritic": 46, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The secret lives of five suburban couples living in Sydney reveal both the fetishes and the repercussions that come with sharing them.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzOTM0OTIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk0NDMzMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1435276800000, "runtime": 96, "title": "The Little Death", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$12.1k", "consensus": "The Little Death may appeal to fans of dark, risqu\u00e8 comedy, but it's ultimately too rough and uneven to hang together as a wholly satisfying viewing experience.", "critic": {"meter": 60, "numReviews": 45, "rating": 6.1}, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1440010525000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 18, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 1224, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.magpictures.com/thelittledeath/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Josh Lawson"], "year": 2014}
