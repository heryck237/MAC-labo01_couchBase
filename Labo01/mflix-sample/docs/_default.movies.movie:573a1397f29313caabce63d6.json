Unbeknownst to the passengers, the visas they purchased were from a corrupt Cuban director of immigration, and they were invalid. Upon arrival in Havana, only 28 people were allowed to disembark, while the rest remained on board for weeks as they sailed to Florida, and eventually Canada, searching for safe haven. Sadly the ship returned to Antwerp after more than a month at sea. Forced back under Nazi rule as the low countries fell, it is estimated that approximately 250 of the refugees died in the extermination camps in occupied Poland.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 75406, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 1763}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:59:02.180000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The tragic 1939 voyage of SS St. Louis carrying hundreds of German Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany that seemingly no nation is willing to save from certain doom.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI3MjU1ODAtOTliZS00MzkwLTg1NGEtZDJjZDI5NTNkOTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 220060800000, "runtime": 155, "title": "Voyage of the Damned", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 9, "rating": 5.7}, "dvd": 946944000000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1440011021000, "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 446, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steve Shagan (screenplay)", "David Butler (screenplay)", "Gordon Thomas (based on the book \"Voyage of the Damned\")", "Max Morgan Witts (book)"], "year": 1976}
