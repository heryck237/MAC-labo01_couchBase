Uncle Mickey sends them money to survive. When Mickey's daughter Rita runs away from an asylum, Vivian's dad offers shelter to her if Mickey will pay for a plush flat. Vivian must babysit her adult cousin, making sure she gets to nursing school and avoids pills and booze. But Vivian has her own problems: she's curious about sex, likes an older neighbor kid, has inherited her mother's ample breasts, and wants a family that doesn't embarrass her. Can she help Rita, keep Uncle Mickey happy, and feel OK about her body and her family?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 120831, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 9126}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:52:35.123000000", "metacritic": 69, "plot": "This semiautobiographical story follows a lower-middle-class teenager (Lyonne) and her neurotic family in 1976 Tinseltown.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJmNzM0OGYtN2M3Zi00MWJkLThkNTQtMmQ4MjFkOTdlYzg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 903052800000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Slums of Beverly Hills", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Warm, real, and hilarious.", "critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 60, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 916704000000, "fresh": 48, "lastUpdated": 1442082026000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 12, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 8690, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tamara Jenkins"], "year": 1998}
