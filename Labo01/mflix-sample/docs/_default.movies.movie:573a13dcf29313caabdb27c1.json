Lifelong employee and self-described 'company man' HENRY WOOD (Eddie Jemison) should have been handed the reins to the company after his father died three months ago, but he was instead passed over by the board for an interim president, WALT FORD (Robert Forster). Today, top management has gathered at headquarters to await an offer of acquisition that will make them each rich beyond their dreams--and divorce Henry once and for all from the business his grandfather started 80 years earlier. The day starts badly when Walt Ford is found hanging from a noose in the boardroom. When management elects to ignore the suicide until their deal has closed, the decision sends the entire office into a death spiral of finger pointing, deal-making, prophetic PowerPoint presentations and gruesome murders. Those left alive must work together to find a killer before the killer finds them.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 2396350, "rating": 7, "votes": 39}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:49:37.330000000", "plot": "From its humble beginnings as a tannery for hog bellies, the Wood and Wood corporation has evolved into a vast, corrupt modern-day holdings corporation.
