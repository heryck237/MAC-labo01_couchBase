Caught in a shoot-out in an Eastern European war zone, Kate spots a young girl running through the chaos. Intrigued, she follows the Girl, photographing as she goes. The Girl accidentally encounters a Gunman who interrogates her, pressing his AK-47 to her head. Kate photographs the terrified Girl and is horrified when the Girl makes eye contact with her, pleading to Kate for help. But Kate is too engrossed in her photography. She takes picture after picture as the girl is shot in front of her. Kate's work is nominated for the New Photographer of the Year Award.
