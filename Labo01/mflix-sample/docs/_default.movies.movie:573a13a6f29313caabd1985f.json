The movie follows a young boy and his uncle (a private investigator). The story is set in the far future where humans and robots live together, unfortunately not in harmony. Many robots are forced underground and are terminated for entering unauthorized areas. They are more or less servants to humankind. The plot starts to unfold when the boy meets a robot named Tima and they get in all kinds of trouble. Never a dull moment when you've got a robot by your side.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 293416, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 15956}, "languages": ["Japanese", "French", "German", "Italian", "Spanish", "English", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:25:07.373000000", "metacritic": 75, "plot": "Kenichi and his uncle Shunsaku Ban must find the mystery behind robot girl Tima.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRkOGM0N2UtMTIyZi00MjA4LTg0NjQtN2RkYTQwMGJlNzFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYzNTI2ODc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1011916800000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Metropolis", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.5M", "consensus": "A remarkable technical achievement, Metropolis' eye-popping visuals more than compensate for its relatively routine story.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 60, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1019520000000, "fresh": 52, "lastUpdated": 1441995635000, "production": "TriStar Pictures", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 25219, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.metropolis-movie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Osamu Tezuka (comic book)", "Katsuhiro \u00e8tomo (screenplay)", "Marc Handler (English version)"], "year": 2001}
