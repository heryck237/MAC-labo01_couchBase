The rest of her life is cushy but bland: scrambled egg whites, decaffeinated coffee and her husband, Ray. She's had enough and runs away from home. Her estranged son, Elliot, finds her lurking outside his restaurant with suitcase in hand. They try to start over again as mother and son in this odd-couple living situation. But she's old-fashioned. He's gay. Between them are years of awkward moments and unspoken tensions. Feeling lonely, Emma accidentally befriends the lady next door who's so eccentric that Emma's way over her head. Meanwhile, a passionate encounter with a man in a bar turns Elliot's fear of commitment on its head. With dumplings, dessert, whiskey, and even Ecstasy in front of them, will they give into their indulgences? And can mother and son reconcile while struggling to discover their own appetites for life?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 2274604, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 314}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:40:57.120000000", "plot": "When Emma moves in with her estranged, gay son, the pair must learn to reconnect through food where words fail, and face the foreclosure of the family's Chinese restaurant and a stubborn fear of intimacy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NjgxMzU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDgxNDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1402790400000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Eat with Me", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439924788000, "production": "Eat With Me Productions", "viewer": {"numReviews": 23, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://eatwithmemovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Au"], "year": 2014}
