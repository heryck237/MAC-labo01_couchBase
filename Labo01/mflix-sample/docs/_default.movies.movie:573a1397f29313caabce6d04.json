Some numbers they do alone, some songs include guest artists from Ronnie Hawkins (their first boss, when they were the Hawks) to Bob Dylan (their last, when as his backup and as a solo group, they came into their own). Scorsese's camera explores the interactions onstage in the making of music. Offstage, he interviews the Band's five members, focusing on the nature of life on the road. The friendships, the harmonies, the hijinks, and the wear and tear add up to a last waltz.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 77838, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 11928}, "languages": ["English", "Middle English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:03:08.437000000", "metacritic": 88, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A film account and presentation of the final concert of The Band.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2N2RkMGEtMGJjZS00OTk0LTk5NjgtNTg4ZjdiNDI2ZjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 262396800000, "runtime": 117, "title": "The Last Waltz", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Among one of, if not the best rock movie ever made, The Last Waltz is a revealing, electrifying view of the classic band at their height.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 44, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1020729600000, "fresh": 43, "lastUpdated": 1441905065000, "production": "MGM", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 13474, "rating": 4.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mardik Martin (treatment)"], "year": 1978}
