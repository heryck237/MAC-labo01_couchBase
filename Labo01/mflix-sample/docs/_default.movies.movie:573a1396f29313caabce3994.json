Patriotically singing \"God Save Mrs. Etheyl Shroake, Long Live Mrs. Etheyl Shroake\", they wander through this surrealistic landscape, forever being warned by the police to \"keep moving\", and prone to the occasional mutation into a parrot, cupboard, or even, yes, a bed sitting room with \"No Wogs\" scrawled in the grime on it's windows. In particular, this story revolves around the odd \"love story\" of a girl who lives with her parents in one compartment of a London Underground train, the commuter in the next compartment, and the doctor they meet after returning above ground in search of a nurse for the heavily pregnant girl.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 64074, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 1387}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:12:59.970000000", "plot": "Set in post-nuclear-holocaust England, where a handful of bizarre characters struggle on with their lives in the ruins, amongst endless heaps of ash, piles of broken crockery and brick, ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRlYjE4OGItNzUzNy00MTUwLThkY2MtMTA4NGZjMTYxY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 86400000, "runtime": 90, "title": "The Bed Sitting Room", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442260324000, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 449, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Antrobus (screenplay)", "Charles Wood (adaptation)", "Spike Milligan (play)", "John Antrobus (play)"], "year": 1969}
