The attack on Pearl Harbor changes their destination, and their lives. Sent to Bataan, in the Philippines, the nurses are led by Lt. Janet Davidson. She is faced with untested nurses who expected an easy time in Honolulu, but who quickly become battle-weary veterans dealing with daily bombardments by the Japanese, overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded, and dwindling supplies. Some of \"Davey's\" unit also have to deal with romantic entanglements with men they met onboard ship. When Bataan falls, the American forces flee to the offshore island of Corregidor, where they find the Japanese assault just as intense.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 36367, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1127}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-13 00:11:54.870000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A group of nurses returning from the war in the Phillippines recall their experiences in combat and in love.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI0Mjk2MmItOGM1MS00MjQ5LWE0YjktODk2ZmVjNjcyYTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -816393600000, "runtime": 126, "title": "So Proudly We Hail!", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1179792000000, "lastUpdated": 1435780586000, "production": "Paramount Vantage", "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 341, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Allan Scott"], "year": 1943}
