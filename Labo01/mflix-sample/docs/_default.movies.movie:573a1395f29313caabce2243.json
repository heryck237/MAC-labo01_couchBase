For the sake of her family, Ang\u00e8lique reluctantly agrees to the match but refuses the advances of her husband, who does not enforce his conjugal rights, wishing only to win her heart. As Angelique gradually discovers virtuous Peyrac's remarkable talents as scientist, musician and philosopher, she falls passionately in love with him. Joffrey's unusual way of life is threatened by the ambitious Archbishop of Toulouse, and soon the jealous young king Louis XIV: Joffrey is arrested for 'sorcery'. Ang\u00e8lique single-handedly faces the royal court, surviving murder and poison attempts on herself in a fruitless effort to save Joffrey from the stake. Intent on revenge and survival on her own, Ang\u00e8lique desperately joins the dark Paris underworld, finding it now ruled by her youth friend, farmer's son Nicolas, whose true love she had forsaken for her arranged marriage.", "genres": ["Adventure", "History", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 57846, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 1686}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-30 00:27:19.567000000", "plot": "In the first of the Ang\u00e8lique series, the beautiful feisty teenage heroine becomes entangled in a political assassination plot and is betrothed to a stranger who is twelve years her senior and a reputed sorcerer.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mzg1NTY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ3MzQyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -159840000000, "runtime": 115, "title": "Ang\u00e8lique", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1209427200000, "lastUpdated": 1439839376000, "viewer": {"meter": 70, "numReviews": 114, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anne Golon (novel)", "Serge Golon (novel)", "Claude Brul\u00e8", "Bernard Borderie", "Francis Cosne", "Daniel Boulanger (dialogue)"], "year": 1964}
