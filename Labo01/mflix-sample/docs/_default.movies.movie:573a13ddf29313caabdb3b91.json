A Presidential Commission was immediately convened to explore what had gone wrong, but with the vast complexity of the space shuttle and so many vested interests involved in the investigation, discovering the truth presented an almost impossible challenge. A truly independent member of the investigation was Richard Feynman. One of the most accomplished scientists of his generation, he worked on the Manhattan Project building the first atom bomb and won the Nobel Prize for his breakthroughs in quantum physics. Feynman deployed exceptional integrity, charm and relentless scientific logic to investigate the secrets of the Shuttle disaster and in doing so, helped make the US Space Programme safer.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2421662, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2877}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 02:23:53.910000000", "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "Factual drama exploring the truth behind the space shuttle Challenger's 1986 explosion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg5ZWI2MGItOTIwMC00YzFjLTg4NTktYzE2ZDE1MjBmZTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1384560000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "The Challenger Disaster", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1437162908000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 1, "rating": 0}, "website": "http://www.thewoundandthegift.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kate Gartside"], "year": 2013}
