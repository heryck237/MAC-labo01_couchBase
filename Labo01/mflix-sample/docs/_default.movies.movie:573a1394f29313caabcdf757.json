The island's only inhabitants are the overseer of the abandoned plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. Discipline is represented by a former warrant officer but ends when he suffers a loss-of-face catastrophe. Soon, discipline and rationality are replaced by a struggle for power and the woman. Power is represented by a pair of pistols found in the wreckage of an American airplane, so important that five men pay for their lives in a bid for supremacy.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 46712, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 370}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-01 00:26:16.657000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Josef von Sternberg directed, photographed, provides the voice-over narration and wrote the screenplay (from a based-on-actual event novel by Michiro Maruyana translated by Younghill Kang) ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDFjNDQ4MzItNTgzMy00YzE2LTk4M2QtZGFjOWM0MWVjNmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTg2NTc4MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -493171200000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Ana-ta-han", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442168541000, "production": "Reel Media International", "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 216, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Younghill Kang (novel)", "Michiro Maruyama (novel)", "Josef von Sternberg (screenplay)"], "year": 1953}
