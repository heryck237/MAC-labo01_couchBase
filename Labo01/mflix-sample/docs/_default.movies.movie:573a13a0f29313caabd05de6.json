Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an FBI agent comes to ask for a desperate favour. They had just tracked down a notorious serial killer, Carl Stargher, whose MO is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about 40 hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs, but Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.", "genres": ["Horror", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 209958, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 75950}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:39:06.267000000", "metacritic": 40, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An FBI agent persuades a social worker, who is adept with a new experimental technology, to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer in order to learn where he has hidden his latest kidnap victim.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDY1NmVmOTItYWU0NC00OGU2LWIyNTctYTU3NTY3ZjJkOWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 966556800000, "runtime": 107, "title": "The Cell", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$60.0M", "consensus": "The Cell offers disturbing, stunning eye candy, but it is undermined by a weak and shallow plotline that offers nothing new.", "critic": {"meter": 46, "numReviews": 146, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 977184000000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1442165439000, "production": "New Line Cinema", "rotten": 79, "viewer": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 180365, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://www.cellmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Protosevich"], "year": 2000}
