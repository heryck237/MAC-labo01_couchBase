It is the final chapter in the lives of Georg Bjarnfredarson, an over-educated know-it-all, social outcast, closeted gay man, and his friends and co-workers. Sitting with him high in the ladder, letting life bedazzle his eyes with perplexity, is Daniel S\u00e8varson, a shy young man who is wrangling with an uncontrollable web of lies he has concocted to deceive his family who think he is finishing medical school. Those two characters are joined by Olafur Ragnar, a 40-year-old man-child still struggling to fit in a normal society. The story begins when Georg is released on parole after a long stay in jail for murder. His mother, an obstinate feminist, refuses to take him in, practically disowning him. Daniel, an old friend, whom Georg tried to frame for the murder he had committed, reluctantly invites him to stay at his place until he gets back on his feet. Olafur, Georg's former co-worker, is also staying at Daniel's house, pretty much to the annoyance of Daniel's wife Ylfa. When these three reconnect is when hell breaks loose.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1534397, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 642}, "languages": ["Icelandic"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:36:49.443000000", "plot": "Georg tries to get his life back on track after a five year stint in jail.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNzYxNzM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYxMDExMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1261785600000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Mr. Bjarnfre\u00e8arson", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439495426000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 5, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ragnar Bragason", "J\u00e8n Gnarr", "J\u00e8hann \u00e8var Gr\u00e8msson", "J\u00e8rundur Ragnarsson", "P\u00e8tur J\u00e8hann Sigf\u00e8sson"], "year": 2009}
