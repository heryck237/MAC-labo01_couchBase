However, after burning his drafts, his publisher shows him a newspaper with an account of events just like his forbidden story. As the film progresses, fantasy and reality intermingle in a tale that draws heavily on influences from Poe and Stoker's Dracula. The film's strongly Expressionistic direction skillfully combines a variety of media (animation, computer-generated imagery, grainy black-and-white fast film stock, color negatives) for artistic effect.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 110943, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 496}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-11 00:14:02.907000000", "plot": "Edogawa Rampo is a writer whose latest work is censored by the government, deemed too disturbing and injurious to the public to be allowed to be published.
