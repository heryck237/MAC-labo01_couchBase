Series 7 literally gives its contestants the guns. The film is not merely a satire on reality TV. It is an example of just how far people will shamelessly go for fame. 6 contenders are pitted against each other in a no holds barred, kill or be killed contest. The reigning champ is Dawn, a hard-nosed, mother-to-be. We go back and forth between Dawn and the other 5 contenders to see if someone can dethrone Dawn and become the new Champion. What is the prize? How are the contestants picked? These questions are not as important as asking yourself how shameless has our society become?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 251031, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 5738}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 00:15:56.710000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "A TV program selects people at random to kill one another for fame and their freedom.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NzU4MjUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwMTc4._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 990748800000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Series 7: The Contenders", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Boasting no big-name stars, Series 7 is surprisingly well-acted.
