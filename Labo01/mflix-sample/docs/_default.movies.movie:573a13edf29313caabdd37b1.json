After a career as an internationally acclaimed lyricist, he lost all language and was only able to say two phrases: \"The Possibilities are Endless\" and \"Grace Maxwell\". The film is narrated by Edwyn, trapped inside his devastated mind and his wife Grace, the woman who pulled him back to life. More than just a story of determination against all odds; it is an intimate and life-affirming journey of rediscovery that celebrates how love, music and language shape our lives.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 3512066, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 170}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 01:36:48.950000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Imagine your mind has been wiped: memories, knowledge, experiences, language - every word you ever spoke, has vanished.
