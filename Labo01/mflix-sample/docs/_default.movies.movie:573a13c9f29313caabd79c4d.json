Life goes on without major mishaps in a large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is a wonderful world, a great bubble of comfort, where different personal spheres coexist: the mother, along with her three children and the Aymara inhabitants of the house. The drama surfaces slowly, without narrative ploys, observing day-to-day activities until internal and external forces make the bubble burst. The film relates the story of the final days of an upper-class family, at a time when the country is undergoing social changes.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1526317, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 232}, "languages": ["Spanish", "Aymara"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:14:31.677000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "For a rich upper-class family locked into their own little world, Bolivia's social changes threaten to burst their bubble.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMzcxNjI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA5NzkxMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1299801600000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Southern District", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439576537000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 1, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Juan Carlos Valdivia (screenplay)"], "year": 2009}
