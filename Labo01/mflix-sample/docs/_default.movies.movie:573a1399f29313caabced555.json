An artist, Hans Hojby, meets Sofie and is entranced, asking to paint her parents and also sketching her. She's responds, but he's not Jewish, and the family reacts by encouraging a marriage to Jonas, a homely draper. Sofie accepts this plan, accompanying her new husband to his town and bearing a son. As he withdraws in mental illness, Sofie begins an affair with his brother, and later returns to live with her parents.
