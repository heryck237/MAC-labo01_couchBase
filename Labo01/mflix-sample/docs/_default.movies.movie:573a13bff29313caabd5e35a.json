It's October, 2008: a presidential election nears and the economy is in free fall. She has a boyfriend, Chris (Chris Santos), who's a personal trainer. We are shown five non-consecutive days in Chelsea's life. She's working on her Web page, talking to image consultants, and being interviewed by a reporter. She asks clients when their birthdays are and uses that for an astrological prediction. She's drawn to a new client, a writer from L.A. Should she break her rules for him? What if it risks her relationship with Chris? Should she invest in gold?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1103982, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 12991}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 07:39:57.150000000", "metacritic": 66, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A drama set in the days leading up to the 2008 Presidential election, and centered on a high-end Manhattan call girl meeting the challenges of her boyfriend, her clients, and her work.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTY5MDIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU4NzQ0Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1247011200000, "runtime": 77, "title": "The Girlfriend Experience", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.6M", "consensus": "Steven Soderbergh's latest lo-fi production is strikingly crafted but emotionally vague.", "critic": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 135, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1254182400000, "fresh": 89, "lastUpdated": 1439575532000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 46, "viewer": {"meter": 35, "numReviews": 32962, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://girlfriendexperiencefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Levien", "Brian Koppelman"], "year": 2009}
