The film finds enduring significance in Munch's brief affair with \"Mrs. Heiberg\" and his participation in the caf\u00e8 society of anarchist Hans Jaeger in Christiania and later in Berlin with Strindberg. Through it all comes Munch's melancholy and his desire to render on canvas, cardboard, paper, stone, and wood his innermost feelings.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 74462, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 2054}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Norwegian", "German", "Swedish", "Danish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:05:17.720000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Following a rough chronology from 1884 to 1894, when Norwegian artist Edvard Munch began expressionism and established himself as northern Europe's most maligned and controversial artist, ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUxZGRkNDAtMzc4Yi00NWIyLWJhMWEtOTFmNmNhODNmN2JhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 153446400000, "runtime": 210, "title": "Edvard Munch", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 12, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 774057600000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1441995975000, "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 1087, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Peter Watkins"], "year": 1974}
