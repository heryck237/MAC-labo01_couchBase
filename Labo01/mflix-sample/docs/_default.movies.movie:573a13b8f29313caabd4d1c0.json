Bill is a pedophile, so Trish couldn't be more excited to have Harvey (Lerner), a \"normal\" father figure for her two sons. But when Bill is released from prison and the boys finally meet their future stepdad, the family is forced to decide whether to forgive or to forget. Trish's sister, the virginal, angelic Joy (Henderson), is also haunted by ghosts of lovers past. On leave from her degenerate husband, Allen (Williams), and her job at a New Jersey correctional facility, Joy unwittingly leaves behind a trail of shame and exposed secrets wherever she goes. In one of the film's most stylized sequences, the image of Joy walking the dark streets of Miami in her nightgown maintains her innocence against a backdrop of self-affliction and desire.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 808526, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 5150}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:57:35.260000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Friends, family, and lovers struggle to find love, forgiveness, and meaning in a war-torn world riddled with comedy and pathos.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNzg2NzUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEzOTM2Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1271376000000, "runtime": 98, "title": "Life During Wartime", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.3M", "consensus": "With Life During Wartime, Todd Solondz delivers an unexpected semi-sequel to Happiness in typically uncompromising fashion.", "critic": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 97, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1311638400000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1440966145000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 30, "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 6158, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.wercwerkworks.com/projects/lifeduringwartime"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Todd Solondz"], "year": 2009}
