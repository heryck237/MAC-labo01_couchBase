When he realizes he's suicidal, he checks himself into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, thinking they'll do an observation, help him, and send him home in time for school the next day. Once in, however, he must stay for a week; the juvenile ward is being renovated, so he's in with adults as well as a few youths. Bobby, a man with a young daughter, shows him around; Craig notices Noelle, about his age. He tries to keep his friends from finding out where he is. Little things: he draws, goes to therapy, sings, helps Bobby rehearse an interview. Is this the stuff of insight?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 804497, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 96810}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:36:35.993000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A clinically depressed teenager gets a new start after he checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTAyNjQ2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwOTU3Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1286496000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "It's Kind of a Funny Story", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.4M", "consensus": "It's amiable, and it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping psych ward comedy cliches, but given its talented cast and directors, It's Kind of a Funny Story should be more than just mildly entertaining.", "critic": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 129, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 1297123200000, "fresh": 75, "lastUpdated": 1442080221000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 54, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 33419, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.itskindofafunnystorymovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anna Boden (screenplay)", "Ryan Fleck (screenplay)", "Ned Vizzini (novel)"], "year": 2010}
