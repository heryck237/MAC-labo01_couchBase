The army sends reservists, mostly married middle-aged men - and the local beauty Andula, spurns those bold enough to try to win her, for the jazz pianist, newly come from Prague to perform. He seduces her and impresses her, telling her \"most women are round, like guitars but you are a guitar by Picasso\".

His protective Mamma and weary Pappa are not pleased when she arrives on the doorstep with her suitcase.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 59415, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 4823}, "languages": ["Czech"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:57:05.403000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A factory manager in rural Czechoslovakia bargains with the army to send men to the area, to boost the morale of his young female workers, deprived of male company since the local boys have...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZDIwZDQtZjhhNS00ZmZjLTg4MTQtNzlkMjBkMGZhY2FiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzEyNjUwMTA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -100483200000, "runtime": 88, "title": "The Loves of a Blonde", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 8}, "dvd": 1013472000000, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1440612339000, "production": "Prominent Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 2751, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Milos Forman (screenplay)", "Milos Forman (story)", "Jaroslav Papousek (screenplay)", "Jaroslav Papousek (story)", "Ivan Passer (screenplay)", "Ivan Passer (story)", "V\u00e8clav Sasek (screenplay)"], "year": 1965}
