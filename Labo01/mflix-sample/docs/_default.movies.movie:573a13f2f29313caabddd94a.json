Struggling to cope with past sexual trauma and the daily aggressions of a male-dominated society, she creates grotesquely costumed alter egos that re-appropriate the male form. While giving her the sense of power she craves, acting as these characters pushes her further into a world of her own making. When she begins a new relationship with a seemingly good guy, she opens herself up to him - but that vulnerability comes at a dangerous cost, and her alter egos threaten to lash out in explosive violence. Based on the real experiences and art of co-writer/star Amy Everson, Felt doesn't just point a finger at rape culture; it takes a full on swing at it, creating a feminist psychological thriller that audiences will be hard-pressed to shake off.", "genres": ["Horror", "Romance", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 3854104, "rating": 4.8, "votes": 182}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:09:44.710000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A woman creates an alter ego in hopes of overcoming the trauma inflicted by men in her life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MzI1Njc5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwMzg4NTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1411171200000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Felt", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jason Banker (story)", "Amy Everson (story)"], "year": 2014}
