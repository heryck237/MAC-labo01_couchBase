An 11-year-old girl has been raped and murdered. Over the next week, De Winter investigates and grieves, his face nearly expressionless. He bikes, he gardens. He accompanies his neighbors, Joseph and Domino, to dinner and to the seaside; he even observes them in vigorous if not rough coitus. For Domino, sex seems her way of connecting. Does she fancy Pharaon? A plowed field, the sea, Pharaon's flowers, the pudenda of Domino and of the ravaged girl - this mix of images of beauty, evil, and possibility assaults Pharaon as he tries to do his job and hold on to his humanity.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 197569, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2651}, "languages": ["French", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:36:24.583000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "When an 11-year-old girl is brutally raped and murdered in a quiet French village, a police detective who has forgotten how to feel emotions--because of the death of his own family in some kind of accident--investigates the crime, which turns out to ask more questions than it answers.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg5ZDE5ZWUtYTcyNC00ZDNhLWE4N2MtYzZhYzkzNDMxYTIyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 940982400000, "runtime": 148, "title": "Humanit\u00e8", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 982022400000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1431111091000, "production": "Winstar Cinema", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 916, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bruno Dumont"], "year": 1999}
