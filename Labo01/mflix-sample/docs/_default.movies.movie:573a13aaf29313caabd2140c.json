The film focuses on Christopher Hitchens' charges against Henry Kissinger as a war criminal - allegations documented in Hitchens' book of the same title - based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and Indonesia. Kissinger's story raises profound questions about American foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing evidence about one man's role in a long history of human rights abuses leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens of international standards of justice.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 326306, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 1629}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 01:04:09.630000000", "metacritic": 72, "plot": "A film about the war crimes of the American diplomat, Henry Kissinger.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEyOTEwMjc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3MTQyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1052265600000, "runtime": 80, "title": "The Trials of Henry Kissinger", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "This compelling unauthorized biography takes a muckraker's view of the controversial diplomat.", "critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 58, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1061251200000, "fresh": 55, "lastUpdated": 1441133618000, "production": "First Run", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 1132, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Alex Gibney", "Christopher Hitchens (book)"], "year": 2002}
