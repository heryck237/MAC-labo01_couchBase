In this racially-charged climate,the LAPD's elite Special Investigations Squad (SIS) is assigned a high-profile quadruple homicide. As they work the case, veteran detective Eldon Perry, known for his tough street tactics and fiery temper, tutors SIS rookie Bobby Keough in the grim realities of police intimidation and corruption. Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Holland, the only man in the department willing to stand up to the SIS, threatens to end Perry's brand of singlehanded \"justice\" on the Los Angeles streets. While navigating through the tumultuous neighborhoods of South Central L.A., Perry and Keough must track down cold-blooded killers and face their own demons, which prove to be more ruthless than the criminals they pursue.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 279331, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 16309}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:07:58.363000000", "metacritic": 57, "plot": "A robbery homicide investigation triggers a series of events that will cause a corrupt LAPD officer to question his tactics.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NkMTZlYjEtODlmNC00ZTBhLWI5MmYtZGQzMmVkNDNjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1045785600000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Dark Blue", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$9.1M", "consensus": "Kurt Russell gives a good performance.
