It explores what was not so easy to discern in the midst of it all - the parallel histories of suffering and loss, and of community coalescence and empowerment. Though this is a San Francisco based story, the issues it addresses extend not only beyond San Francisco but also beyond AIDS itself. 'We Were Here' speaks to our societal relationship to death and illness, our capacity as individuals to rise to the occasion, and the importance of community in addressing unimaginable crises.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1787837, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1299}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:33:53.610000000", "metacritic": 94, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A deep and reflective look at the arrival and impact of AIDS in San Francisco and how individuals rose to the occasion during the first years of this unimaginable crisis.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ4MTY1NjAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA1MTEwNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1314835200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "We Were Here", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 41, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1337040000000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1441992757000, "production": "Independent Films", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 2389, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://wewereherefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2011}
