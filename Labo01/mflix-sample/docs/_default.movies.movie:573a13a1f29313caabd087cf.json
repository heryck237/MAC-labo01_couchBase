We track its development in African American culture, its rise to prominence with its golden age of popularity spanning from the 1920's to the mid 1940's both in its original form and in Swing through its popular decline and the rise of vital new sub-genres into the present day. Along the way, we learn of the lives and work of major contributors to the form such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Charlie \"Bird\" Parker and many others who helped form Jazz into the vibrant musical form it is. Moreover, we see how the music reflected the political and social issues of the African American community over the course of the form's history.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 221300, "rating": 8.4, "votes": 1244}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:23:47.297000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A survey of the musical form's history and major talents.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiNDkzNzgtODQ0NS00N2Q0LWI5YTQtZTJmNmIzMmQ2YTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 978912000000, "runtime": 114, "title": "Jazz", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 4}, "dvd": 955411200000, "fresh": 2, "lastUpdated": 1440099487000, "production": "Artisan Entertainment", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 17, "numReviews": 145, "rating": 2.6}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2001}
