The movie follows Morrison from his days as a film student in Los Angeles to his death in Paris, France at age 27 in 1971. The movie features a tour-de-force performance by Val Kilmer, who not only looks like Jim Morrison's long-lost twin brother, but also sounds so much like him that he did much of his own singing. It has been written that even the surviving Doors had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's originals.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 101761, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 64238}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 01:14:04.267000000", "metacritic": 62, "plot": "The story of the famous and influential 1960s rock band and its lead singer and composer, Jim Morrison, from his days as a UCLA film student in Los Angeles, to his untimely death in Paris, France at age 27 in 1971.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg3YjA5MGYtYjdiNy00YThjLWJiZDEtN2M1NmE1NTVhMWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 667785600000, "runtime": 140, "title": "The Doors", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Val Kilmer delivers a powerhouse performance as one of rock's most incendiary figures, but unfortunately, Oliver Stone is unable to shed much light on the circus surrounding the star.", "critic": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 6}, "dvd": 871948800000, "fresh": 32, "lastUpdated": 1442423403000, "production": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "rotten": 27, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 60170, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Randall Jahnson", "Oliver Stone"], "year": 1991}
