She vows (against all logic) to build a new palace for Caesar within three months. Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 250223, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 34491}, "languages": ["French", "Arabic", "Cantonese", "Latin", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-10 00:37:44.237000000", "plot": "Ast\u00e8rix and Ob\u00e8lix go to Egypt to help architect Num\u00e8robis who is building a palace for Cleopatra.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q3NmUzNjAtM2VjMS00MGU3LWE4YjEtZTM1NDM0YTdlOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODIyOTEyMzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1012348800000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Asterix and Obelix Meet Cleopatra", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 6.3}, "fresh": 6, "lastUpdated": 1442345955000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 20237, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ren\u00e8 Goscinny (comic book \"Ast\u00e8rix et Cl\u00e8opatre\")", "Albert Uderzo (comic book \"Ast\u00e8rix et Cl\u00e8opatre\")", "Alain Chabat (screenplay)"], "year": 2002}
