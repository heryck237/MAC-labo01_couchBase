Careers as a stripper and singer, plus five marriages, replete with allegations of domestic violence are fictionalized sympathetically in this dramedy. Alleged exploitation/manipulation of Matti, due to his naivety and gullibility, along with deterioration of his skiing ability due to heavy drinking and bad decisions is emphasized.
