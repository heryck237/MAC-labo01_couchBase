First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 401787, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 585}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-22 00:09:03.517000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "SIBLINGS is a dark comedy about love, lust, murder and other issues of normal family life.", "rated": "R", "released": 1127174400000, "runtime": 85, "title": "Siblings", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1127174400000, "lastUpdated": 1438020338000, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 1209, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.siblingsthemovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jackie May"], "year": 2004}
