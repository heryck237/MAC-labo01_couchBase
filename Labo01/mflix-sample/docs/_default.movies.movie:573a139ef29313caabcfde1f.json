Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations. The weather, too, is quirky.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 175880, "rating": 8, "votes": 228895}, "languages": ["English", "German", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:33:38.477000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An epic mosaic of interrelated characters in search of love, forgiveness, and meaning in the San Fernando Valley.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk3YThkNDktNjZjMS00MTBiLTllNTAtYzkzMTU0N2QwYjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 947203200000, "runtime": 188, "title": "Magnolia", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Critics say Magnolia is an ambitious, lengthy work that ultimately succeeds due to the interesting stories and excellent ensemble performances.", "critic": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 141, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 964483200000, "fresh": 118, "lastUpdated": 1440094296000, "production": "New Line Cinema", "rotten": 23, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 191012, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.magnoliamovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Thomas Anderson"], "year": 1999}
