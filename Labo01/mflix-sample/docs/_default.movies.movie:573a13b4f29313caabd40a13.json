To pass the long hours of the night, he starts working the late night shift at the local supermarket. There he meets a colorful cast of characters, all of whom have their own 'art' in dealing with the boredom of an eight-hour-shift. Ben's art is that he imagines himself stopping time. This way, he can appreciate the artistic beauty of the frozen world and the people inside it - especially Sharon, the pretty and quiet checkout girl, who perhaps holds the answer to solving the problem of Ben's insomnia.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 460740, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 68930}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:17:12.977000000", "metacritic": 54, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "After a painful breakup, Ben develops insomnia.
