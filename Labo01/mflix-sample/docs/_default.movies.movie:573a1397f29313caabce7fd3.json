Her behavior is bizarre, perhaps mad: she poisons the dog's milk and advises the dog not to drink it; she sets the sheets afire as her husband sleeps; she crawls under the dining table to sing. While detained at airport customs for carrying pruning shears, she meets a young Yugoslav woman and goes with her to a Gypsy enclave where she's fought over, takes a lover, helps with the sordid entertainment at a bar, and returns home more dangerous than before. The film also tells parallel stories of Marilyn's daughter becoming a junior homemaker as the young immigrant practices her striptease.", "genres": ["Drama", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 82770, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 1527}, "languages": ["English", "Swedish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:39:49.730000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A bored wealthy housewife on the verge of insanity cuts loose with some lively Yugoslavian immigrants who delight in their bohemian lifestyle.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM5NDhiOGQtNjQyNy00MzM2LWFhMTAtNTUyZGJhZWVhZTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 371433600000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Montenegro", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 13, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 1000166400000, "fresh": 12, "lastUpdated": 1442342668000, "production": "Atlantic Releasing Corporation", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 879, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Donald Arthur", "Dusan Makavejev", "Branko Vucicevic"], "year": 1981}
