It's the early days of package tourism, and he is too shy and clueless to really sort out any of his problems -- a suitcase filled with women's clothes, a flirtatious female roommate, and no money to buy food since he was prepared for full room & board in Austria. Other characters represent (stereo)typical Finns from different walks of life, most of them on their first beach holiday just like Aimo (to whom even the boiled eggs in the hotel breakfast room are enough to cause a daily culture shock).", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 74813, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 241}, "languages": ["Finnish"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:45:14.800000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A shy Finn boards a wrong plane and ends up on a beach holiday instead of skiing.", "released": 219628800000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Olympian Holiday", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1416945665000, "viewer": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 84, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Risto Jarva", "Kullervo Kukkasj\u00e8rvi", "Jussi Kyl\u00e8tasku"], "year": 1976}
