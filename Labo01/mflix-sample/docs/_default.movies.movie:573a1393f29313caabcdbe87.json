The only person to talk to him honestly about his acting is Otoku, the wet-nurse of his adoptive father's child. She is fired by the family, and Kikunosuke is forbidden to see her, because of the gossip a relationship with a servant would cause. Kikunosuke falls in love with Otoku, and leaves home to try to make a living on his own merits outside Tokyo. He is eventually joined by Otoku, who encourages him to become a famous actor to regain the recognition of his family.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 32156, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1813}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:02:15.937000000", "plot": "In Tokyo in 1888, Kikunosuke Onoue, the adoptive son of an important actor, discovers that he is praised for his acting only because he is his father's heir, and that the troupe complains ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmEyNTMzMGEtMzJjOS00Yjg1LTgwMjgtM2Q2M2NiY2ZhYzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 285206400000, "runtime": 148, "title": "Zangiku monogatari", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 6, "rating": 8.8}, "fresh": 6, "lastUpdated": 1442336776000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 722, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Matsutar\u00e8 Kawaguchi", "Sh\u00e8f\u00e8 Muramatsu (novel)", "Yoshikata Yoda"], "year": 1939}
