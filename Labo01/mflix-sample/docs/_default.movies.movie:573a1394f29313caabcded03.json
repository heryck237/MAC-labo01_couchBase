His plan is relatively simple. Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants disposed of. For example, Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam, freeing him to marry Anne Morton, the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand but but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the 'bargain' and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks, Bruno makes it quite clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused him a divorce. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder, forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings.", "genres": ["Crime", "Film-Noir", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 44079, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 86343}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:22:50.290000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A psychotic socialite confronts a pro tennis star with a theory on how two complete strangers can get away with murder...a theory that he plans to implement.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5N2ZjNWMtNWVkZi00MzYyLTkxNjYtMzc0NjE0MDFjNGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -584064000000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Strangers on a Train", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A provocative premise and inventive set design lights the way for Hitchcock diabolically entertaining masterpiece.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 42, "rating": 8.8}, "dvd": 872640000000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1442258665000, "production": "Warner Home Video", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 34800, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Raymond Chandler (screen play)", "Czenzi Ormonde (screen play)", "Whitfield Cook (adaptation)", "Patricia Highsmith (from the novel by)"], "year": 1951}
