A horse trips on a wire and throws the rider; a woman falls to her death through rotted planks; the local baron's son is hung upside down in a mill; parents slap and bully their children; a man is cruel to his long-suffering lover; another sexually abuses his daughter. People disappear. A callow teacher, who courts a nanny in the baron's household, narrates the story and tries to investigate the connections among these accidents and crimes. What is foreshadowed? Are the children holy innocents? God may be in His heaven, but all is not right with the world; the center cannot hold.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 1149362, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 48997}, "languages": ["German", "Italian", "Polish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:38:26.697000000", "metacritic": 82, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Strange events happen in a small village in the north of Germany during the years just before World War I, which seem to be ritual punishment.
