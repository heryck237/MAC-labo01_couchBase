The first sequence is a simple demonstration of the canon \"Frere Jacques\" where four cubes dance and combine with one another on a checkerboard. The second sequence show four little human-like figures dancing in space. The third and most elaborate sequence shows a human going through several strange gesticulations. Through multiple printing we realize that the man, as in the previous sequences, is part of a visual canon and is making the gestures to himself. As we hear variations on the canonic theme so too do we witness visual variations: a woman and cat enters the canon. To show the musical technique of inversion, the image of the man is printed upside down.", "genres": ["Animation", "Short"], "imdb": {"id": 57912, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 161}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-27 00:19:12.967000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Perhaps the only film whose content is totally based on the musical form known as canon.
