Many years prior to this incident, a group of eminent scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone advocated for the construction of a secure laboratory facility that would serve as a base in the event an alien biological life form was returned to Earth from a space mission. Stone and his team - Drs. Dutton, Leavitt and Hall - go to the facility, known as Wildfire, and try to first isolate the life form while determining why two people from Piedmont (an old wino and a six-month-old baby) survived. The scientists methodically study the alien life form unaware that it has already mutated and presents a far greater danger in the lab, which is equipped with a nuclear self-destruct device should it manage to escape.", "genres": ["Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 66769, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 24041}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:19:48.040000000", "plot": "A group of scientists investigates a deadly new alien virus before it can spread.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY4NGZkOTMtNTRjNy00NWY4LWI2ZmUtODc3NWY3MTBhNzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 37584000000, "runtime": 131, "title": "The Andromeda Strain", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 67, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 971049600000, "fresh": 16, "lastUpdated": 1440094423000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 8482, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Michael Crichton (novel)", "Nelson Gidding (screenplay)"], "year": 1971}
