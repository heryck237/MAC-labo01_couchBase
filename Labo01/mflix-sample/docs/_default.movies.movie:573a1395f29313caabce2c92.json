The two decide that rather than turn Basini in to the school authorities, they will punish him themselves and proceed to torture, degrade, and humiliate the boy, with ever-increasing sadistic delight. As each day passes, the two boys are able to justify harsher treatment than previously given. Torless is a passive member of the group but observes rather than participates and frustrates the tormentors by dryly analyzing their behavior.", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 60574, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 1482}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:28:46.680000000", "plot": "At a boarding school in the pre-war Austro-Hungarian Empire, a pair of students torture one of their fellow classmates, Basini, who has been caught stealing money from one of the two.
