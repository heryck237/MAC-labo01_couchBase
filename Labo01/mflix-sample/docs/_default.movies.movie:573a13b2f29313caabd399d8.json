Wheeler chases any skirt he sees for empty sex. When they get in a fight with a tow-truck driver, they choose community service over jail and are assigned to be big brothers - Danny to Augie, a geek who loves to LARP (Live Action Role Play), and Wheeler to Ronnie, a pint-size foul-mouthed kid. After a rocky start, things start to go well until both Danny and Wheeler make big mistakes. Can the two men figure out how to change enough to be role models to the boys?", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 430922, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 187832}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 01:24:42.480000000", "metacritic": 61, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Wild behavior forces a pair of energy drink reps to enroll in a Big Brother program.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTk4NzQ0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM0OTc5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1226016000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Role Models", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$67.3M", "consensus": "Role Models is a frequently crude, always funny comedy with the cast providing solid work throughout.", "critic": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 157, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1236643200000, "fresh": 122, "lastUpdated": 1442083648000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 35, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 277716, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.rolemodelsmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Timothy Dowling (story)", "W.
