What Steve doesn't know is that the crocodile has innocently swallowed a top secret US satellite beacon, and the poachers are actually American special agents sent to retrieve it. Crikey! In the Outback and through the bush with his wife Terri's ever-present commentary ringing out over the countryside (\"That was a close one, Steve!\"), the Crocodile Hunter is out to save the gorgeous croc and relocate him. It won't be easy, but if he can handle bird-eating spiders and venomous snakes without getting bitten, gun-wielding agents shouldn't be too much of a problem.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 305396, "rating": 5.3, "votes": 5543}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 23:47:27.537000000", "metacritic": 50, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The Crocodile Hunter mistakes some CIA agents for poachers and sets out to stop them from capturing a wily croc which, unbeknownst to him, has swallowed a tracking drone.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NTk2Mjc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU0NjY2._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1026432000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$28.3M", "consensus": "Aside from the unnecessary plot about a downed US spy satellite, there's not much difference between the movie and the TV show.", "critic": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 83, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 1040083200000, "fresh": 44, "lastUpdated": 1441992114000, "production": "MGM Pictures", "rotten": 39, "viewer": {"meter": 43, "numReviews": 43875, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://www.mgm.com/crocodilehunter/home.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Stainton (story)", "Holly Goldberg Sloan (screenplay)"], "year": 2002}
