Without immediate families that they can relate to, and lacking friends their own age, all they have is each other. Through a series of memories and vignettes, 'Jess + Moss' recounts the events of the last summer they shared together. Shot entirely on location with a variety of expired and often degraded film stocks, 'Jess + Moss' captures the evocative and haunting character of the dark fire tobacco fields of rural Western Kentucky.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1787731, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 526}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:09:33.423000000", "metacritic": 71, "plot": "A series of vignettes involving memories of companionship and sexual awakening shared by two second cousins.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NjY5OTY0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk5NTQ0Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1329436800000, "runtime": 83, "title": "Jess + Moss", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1332115200000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1440268154000, "production": "Strand Releasing", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 165, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.jessandmoss.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Clay Jeter (story)", "Debra Jeter (story)", "Nikki Jeter Wilbanks (story)", "Clay Jeter (screenplay)", "Will Basanta (screenplay)", "Isaac Hagy (screenplay)", "Debra Jeter (screenplay)"], "year": 2011}
