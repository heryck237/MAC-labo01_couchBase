In Republic of Macedonia, during war in Bosnia, Christians hunt an ethnic Albanian girl who may have murdered one of their own. A young monk who's taken a vow of silence offers her protection. In London, a photographic editor who's pregnant needs to talk it out with her estranged husband and chooses a toney restaurant. She wants permanence with her lover, a prize-winning Macedonian photographer just back from Bosnia, changed by the violence. He leaves abruptly for his village; he's not visited it in 16 years. There he tries to ignore bitter divisions between his Orthodox brethren and local Albanians, then tries to transcend them.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 110882, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 10587}, "languages": ["Macedonian", "English", "Albanian", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:01:57.553000000", "plot": "The circularity of violence seen in a story that circles on itself.
