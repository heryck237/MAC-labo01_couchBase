He's tailing a kid who smokes pot and may be supplying his friends. Cristi dislikes the assignment: the kid's clearly not a dealer, an arrest would ruin his life, and, Cristi assumes that Romania will soon tolerate marijuana. His superior tells him flatly that the law is the law and to finish the case with a quick arrest. Cristi wants to follow the informant, a youth whose father is a builder. Cristi watches, he smokes, he writes reports, he wants to meet with the prosecutor. Can a cop have a conscience? Is the noun being modified \"procedural\" or \"state\"?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1337051, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 3555}, "languages": ["Romanian"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:25:56.927000000", "metacritic": 81, "plot": "A police officer refuses to arrest a young man for offering drugs to his friends.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk3YzBkMGUtOTdiNC00ZjE1LWI5NGYtZWIyYTllNGMzNDgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1246579200000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Police, Adjective", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$26.7k", "critic": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1275350400000, "fresh": 57, "lastUpdated": 1442343023000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 1504, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.42kmfilm.ro/ro/politist-adjectiv"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Corneliu Porumboiu (screenplay)"], "year": 2009}
