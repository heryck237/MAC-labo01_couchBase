Abandoned by her husband, Barbi is dragged into trouble by her girlfriend, who spouts women's lib as she gets Barbi to discard her bra and go out on the town. Barbi becomes a Red Riding Hood in a sea of wolves, and quickly learns a lot more than she wanted to about nudist camps, the hippie scene, orgies, bisexuality, sadism, drugs, and bohemia. Saturated to the hilt with vibrant color and exquisite period detail, and full of the kind of innocent nude romps you see before censorship codes lifted, VIVA looks like a lost film from the late '60's, and is a tribute to the best of exploitation cinema, from Herschell Gordon Lewis' Suburban Roulette to Radley Metzger's Camille 2000.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 393956, "rating": 5.7, "votes": 514}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:03:50.937000000", "plot": "Two suburban couples experiment with sex, drugs and bohemia in early 1970's Los Angeles.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NjIyMzQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MTE0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1209686400000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Viva", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anna Biller"], "year": 2007}
