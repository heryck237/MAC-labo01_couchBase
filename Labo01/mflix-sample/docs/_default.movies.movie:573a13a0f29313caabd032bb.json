Taking a man that was found dead on the beach, they arrange what appears to a mob hit and provide a note that says more killings are to occur. Unfortunately the old man they use turns out to be the senile father of a drug lord. The drug lord declares war on the killers of his father, thinking it was an action of his enemies. A stripper learns of the old men's involvement and threatens to squeal on them unless they kill her stepmother. Meanwhile, one man searches for his long-lost daughter, who is the investigating police officer, trying to divest herself from her crumb fellow officer and former boyfriend.", "genres": ["Crime", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 198386, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 3780}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 01:04:07.970000000", "metacritic": 37, "plot": "Four retired mobsters plan one last crime to save their retirement home.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NDA2NTY2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg2MjIyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 967161600000, "runtime": 88, "title": "The Crew", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$12.5M", "consensus": "Though the four actors are good together, the jokes are stale and not funny.", "critic": {"meter": 20, "numReviews": 85, "rating": 3.7}, "dvd": 984441600000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1440267309000, "rotten": 68, "viewer": {"meter": 37, "numReviews": 4088, "rating": 2.7}, "website": "http://studio.go.com/movies/thecrew/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Barry Fanaro"], "year": 2000}
