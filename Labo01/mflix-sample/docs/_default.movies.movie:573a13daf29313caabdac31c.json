The kid is a genius, but stammers and is bullied at school. Yonatan's grandfather, Eliahu, whom he had never met, is a former member of the Lehi (pre-State Jewish underground), and a cold person. Eliahu's best friend from Lehi, Nick, is full of ambition and passion that will never materialize; and Eliahu's English brother-in-law, a has-been, third-rate actor in debt for 232,000 euros. There's one thing keeping them together - they all want to rob the bank that employed Yonatan's deceased father to avenge it for not paying the Yonatan's mother compensation for his dad's death, due to the \"small print\" in his employment contract. And they want the money to make their last wish come true.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 2295196, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 645}, "languages": ["Hebrew", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 10:43:42.410000000", "metacritic": 49, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In Jerusalem, a bullied teen befriends his grandfather and long lost uncle and soon they decide to solve their financial problems by robbing a bank.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3Njc2OTM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ1NTg4OTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1385596800000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Hunting Elephants", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 12, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1439164800000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1442084172000, "production": "Xlrator Media", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 142, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Reshef Levi", "Regev Levy"], "year": 2013}
