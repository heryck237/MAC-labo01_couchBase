Bogged down in their trenches on a barren highland, the men of an Italian infantry division have been given one objective: retake a commanding height from the enemy. Unfortunately, the tactical ingenuity of general Leone, the unpopular division commander, consists of supplementing frontal attacks against machine-guns with medieval fighting schemes. His dispirited troops must be prodded with ever harsher measures into storming the Austrian positions. As casualties mount, indignation spreads amongst the rank and file. Disturbed by the decisions of his superiors, lieutenant Sassu is progressively led to question the purpose of the war and to reconsider where his real duties lie.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 66511, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 763}, "languages": ["Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 02:18:01.710000000", "plot": "On the Italian/Austrian front during World War I, a disastrous Italian attack upon the Austrian positions leads to a mutiny among the decimated Italian troops.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWNhMzM3YWMtNzg2MC00ZDY5LTk3N2EtYjU4ODYyZTYyZjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxMDQ0ODk@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 22377600000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Many Wars Ago", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1350345600000, "lastUpdated": 1439751939000, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 101, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tonino Guerra", "Raffaele La Capria", "Emilio Lussu (novel)", "Francesco Rosi"], "year": 1970}
