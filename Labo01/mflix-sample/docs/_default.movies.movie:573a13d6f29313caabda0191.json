Joyce"], "fullplot": "In 2010, the United States announced the first new nuclear power plant construction in over 32 years. The 'Nuclear Renaissance' was born, and America's long-stalled expansion of nuclear energy was infused with new life. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan and caused chaos at the Fukushima Power Plant. That accident sent ripples all the way to the US and suddenly the fierce debate over the safety and viability of nuclear power was back in the public consciousness. Our documentary takes the viewer on a journey to reactor communities around the country. This film exposes the truths and myths of nuclear power, and poses the question of whether or not man can responsibly split the atom.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "News"], "imdb": {"id": 2088919, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 230}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:06:43.267000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A documentary on growing up in Shirley, Long Island -- a nuclear-reactor community.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NDA3OTEyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0NDMyNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1395705600000, "runtime": 95, "title": "The Atomic States of America", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440614059000, "production": "New Video Group", "viewer": {"meter": 41, "numReviews": 37, "rating": 2.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kelly McMasters (based on the book by)"], "year": 2012}
