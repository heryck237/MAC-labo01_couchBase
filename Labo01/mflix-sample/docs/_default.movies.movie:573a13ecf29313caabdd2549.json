Calling themselves the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, they removed every file in the office. Mailed anonymously, the stolen documents started to show up in newsrooms. The heist yielded a trove of damning evidence. The most significant revelation was COINTELPRO, a controversial, secret, illegal surveillance program overseen by lifelong Bureau director J. Edgar Hoover. Despite one of the largest investigations ever conducted, the FBI was unable to catch the burglars. Those responsible have never revealed their identities. Until now. For the first time the burglars have decided to speak about their actions. 1971 is their story, examining the consequences and implications of their actions - then and now.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 3478510, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 219}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:36:39.033000000", "metacritic": 73, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of a notorious 1971 activist burglary of an FBI office that lead to the Bureau's numerous abuses against dissidents being exposed.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTU4NDAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI4NzgzMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1397779200000, "runtime": 79, "title": 1971, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Johanna Hamilton", "Gabriel Rhodes"], "year": 2014}
