Guei arrives from the country: toothbrushes, hotel foyers, and Qin, a rich neighbor in high heels, dazzle him. He gets a job as a messenger. The company issues him a bike, which he must pay for out of his wages. When it is stolen, Guei hunts for it. A student, Jian, has it; for him, it's the key to teen society - with his pals and with Xiao, a girl he fancies. Guei finds the bike and stubbornly tries to reclaim it in the face of great odds. But for Jian to lose the bike would mean humiliation. The two young men - and the people around them - are swept up in the youths' desperation.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 276501, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3721}, "languages": ["Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 01:15:43.803000000", "metacritic": 61, "plot": "A seventeen-year-old country boy working in Beijing as a courier has his bicycle stolen, and finds it with a schoolboy his age.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzQ4NzgxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgzMDAyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 988156800000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Beijing Bicycle", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Though rather repetitive in its plot, Beijing Bicycle provides an interesting look at the economic and social changes that have occurred in China.", "critic": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 59, "rating": 6.5}, "dvd": 1026172800000, "fresh": 37, "lastUpdated": 1439402453000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 4844, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/beijing"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Peggy Chiao", "Hsiao-ming Hsu", "Danian Tang", "Xiaoshuai Wang"], "year": 2001}
