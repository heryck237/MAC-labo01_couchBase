It's the legendary light we see in paintings. The German artist Joseph Beuys, however, says that it lost its unique radiance in the 1950s, bringing an end to a visual culture that had lasted for centuries. Dutch Light breaks new ground by examining this renowned but elusive phenomenon. What is Dutch light? Is the light in Holland really different from that in other parts of the world? What is true, what is myth, what is fiction? And was Joseph Beuys right? Dutch Light addresses these fascinating questions. And it is an ode to light and to observation. It turns looking into a new experience.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 380419, "rating": 7, "votes": 129}, "languages": ["Dutch", "English"], "lastupdated": "2014-07-11 00:30:29.503000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "There's an ancient myth that the light in Holland is different from anywhere else, but it has never been put to the test.
