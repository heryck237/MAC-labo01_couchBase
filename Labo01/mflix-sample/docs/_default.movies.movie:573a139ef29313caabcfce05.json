Dustmen are striking; bags of garbage add to the blight of council flats and a fetid canal. Ryan, who's about 12, drowns during a play fight with his neighbor, the jug-eared James. James runs home, a flat where he lives with his often-drunk da, his ma, and sisters, who live in hope of moving to newly-built council flats. The slice-of-life, coming-of-age story follows James as he tags along with the older lads; has a friendship with his quirky wee rodent-loving neighbor, Kenny; spends time with Margaret Anne, myopic, slightly older, the local sexual punching bag; and, has a moment or two of joy. The strike may end, but is there any way out for James?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 171685, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 5462}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:29:18.110000000", "metacritic": 76, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Glasgow, summer, 1973.
