Holt also harbors ideas about convincing Jane to return to London. When Holt and Arlington show Jane some of the modern clothes and perfumes they brought from civilization, she is impressed but not enough to return. Tarzan wrestles every wild animal imaginable to protect Jane but when he disallows the expedition from plundering ivory from the elephant burial grounds, it is he who takes a bullet from Arlington's gun. Jane eventually believes that Tarzan is dead but he is nursed back to health by the apes. As Jane and the returning expedition are attacked by violent natives, we wonder if Tarzan can rescue them yet again.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "imdb": {"id": 25862, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 3636}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:46:08.960000000", "plot": "The idyllic life of Tarzan and Jane is challenged by men on safari who come seeking ivory, and come seeking Jane as well.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ4OWJhY2MtNWUzZi00YjcwLThhNmEtMWU0YWQzNDEzNDcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": -1126656000000, "runtime": 104, "title": "Tarzan and His Mate", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 680400000000, "fresh": 14, "lastUpdated": 1442259925000, "production": "MGM", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 427, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Edgar Rice Burroughs (based upon the characters created by)", "James Kevin McGuinness (screen play)", "Howard Emmett Rogers (adaptation)", "Leon Gordon (adaptation)"], "year": 1934}
