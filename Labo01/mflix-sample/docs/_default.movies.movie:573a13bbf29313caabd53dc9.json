Karslake"], "fullplot": "We meet five Christian families, each with a gay or lesbian child. Parents talk about their marriages and church-going, their children's childhood and coming out, their reactions, and changes over time. The stories told by these nine parents and four adult children alternate with talking heads - Protestant and Jewish theologians - and with film clips of fundamentalist preachers and pundits and news clips of people in the street. They discuss scripture and biblical scholarship. A thesis of the film is that much of Christianity's homophobia represents a misreading of scripture, a denial of science, and an embrace of quack psychology. The families call for love.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 912583, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 3799}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:00:45.103000000", "metacritic": 73, "plot": "An exploration of the intersection between religion and homosexuality in the U.S. and how the religious right has used its interpretation of the Bible to stigmatize the gay community.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE1Mzk4ODUtZWEzZS00MWY2LWFjMTItNmUzM2MxYmJiMWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1191542400000, "runtime": 95, "title": "For the Bible Tells Me So", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A timely and poignant examination of gays, their families and religion.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 48, "rating": 7.6}, "dvd": 1203379200000, "fresh": 47, "lastUpdated": 1442344821000, "production": "First Run Features", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 4283, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.forthebibletellsmeso.org/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Daniel G.
