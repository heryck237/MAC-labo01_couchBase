Archival footage, news articles, and photographs mix with contemporary interviews of Verg\u00e8s, friends, associates, and historians. Connections with Nazis are explored, as well as Verg\u00e8s's marriage to Djamila Bouhared, his courtroom methods, his disappearance from 1970 to 1978, and the roots of his radicalism. Throughout, Verg\u00e8s remains playful and charming, with a soup\u00e8on of arrogance. The film suggests Verg\u00e8s's anti-colonial nature is at his center.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1032854, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1286}, "languages": ["French", "German", "English", "Khmer"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 01:09:04.807000000", "metacritic": 75, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A documentary on Jacques Verg\u00e8s, the controversial lawyer and former Free French Forces guerrilla who has defending unpopular figures such as Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie and Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODYwMTMzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg4MDU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1181088000000, "runtime": 135, "title": "Terror's Advocate", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Terror's Advocate is a fascinating portrayal of a controversial political figure; both morally unsettling and emotionally gripping.", "critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 42, "rating": 7.5}, "dvd": 1203379200000, "fresh": 36, "lastUpdated": 1439145218000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 66, "numReviews": 1928, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.terrorsadvocatefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2007}
