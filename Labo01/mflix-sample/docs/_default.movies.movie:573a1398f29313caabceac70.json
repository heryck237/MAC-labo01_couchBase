She's self-aware and holds her own in a caf\u00e8 conversation with a concert pianist she meets, but she has a wild streak and she's testing her powers over men, finding that she doesn't always control her moods or actions, and she's impatient with being a virgin. She sets off with her brother to a disco, latching onto an aging playboy who is himself hot and cold to her. She is ambivalent about losing her virginity that night, willing the next, and determined by the third. The playboy's mix of depression and misogyny ends their unconsummated affair, so Lili has to hunt elsewhere.", "genres": ["Romance", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 94596, "rating": 6, "votes": 840}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 01:19:23.473000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A night in the life of a young woman who wishes to learn and experience more of life.
