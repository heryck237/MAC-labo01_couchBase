Determined to run, he practices with his father, Probation Officer Geoff Taylor. Geoff, with additional girth and age working against him, finds he no longer can keep up with his son. He must find a running partner at the school who's fast enough to help Alex make the cross-country team. This help comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Brad Coleman, a schoolmate of Alex's, spends most of his time running from the law. Caught in a pathetic daytime robbery attempt, Brad faces incarceration for repeat offenses.
