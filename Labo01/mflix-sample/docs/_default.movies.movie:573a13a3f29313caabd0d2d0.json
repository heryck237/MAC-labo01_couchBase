Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a painter and a singer, leaves a home for girls to be a governess, armed with pluck, a keen wit, good looks, fluent French, and an eye for social advancement. Society tries its best to keep her from climbing. An episodic narrative follows her for 20 years, through marriage, Napoleonic wars, a child, loyalty to a school friend, the vicissitudes of the family whose daughters she instructed, and attention from a bored marquess who collected her father's paintings. Honesty tempers her schemes. No aristocrat she, nor bourgeois, just spirited, intelligent, and irrepressible.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 241025, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 16614}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:39:11.813000000", "metacritic": 53, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Growing up poor in London, Becky Sharp (Witherspoon) defies her poverty-stricken background and ascends the social ladder alongside her best friend, Amelia.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4OTkwNDY2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIwMzAzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1093996800000, "runtime": 141, "title": "Vanity Fair", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$16.1M", "consensus": "A more likable Becky Sharp makes for a less interesting movie.", "critic": {"meter": 51, "numReviews": 164, "rating": 5.8}, "dvd": 1107216000000, "fresh": 83, "lastUpdated": 1440355588000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 81, "viewer": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 48595, "rating": 3}, "website": "http://www.vanityfairmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Matthew Faulk (screenplay)", "Mark Skeet (screenplay)", "Julian Fellowes (screenplay)", "William Makepeace Thackeray (novel)"], "year": 2004}
