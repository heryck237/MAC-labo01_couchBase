He cannot concentrate on his job nor on his studies, being continuously mindful of his girlfriend and concubine Ana's whereabouts and activities. Toledo arrives home and has a long conversation with Ana, who constantly manifests a ridiculous desire of 'going out for a drink'. They lie in bed but all his advances are instantly rejected by a progressively more nervous Ana. He cannot explain her intermittent crying and disturbed reactions. Until she leaves to the kitchen and he finds out that under the bed a male shoe that does not belong to him is carefully hidden by a male hand, under his own eyes. Paralyzed by the discovery he is only capable of leaving with a stupid excuse, trying to hide from Ana the anguish that barely lets him breath. Toledo awaits on the street for the exit of Ana's lover and begins a one-of-a-kind persecution-investigation that will last the whole night, to find out, before confronting him, who is that man and where did he meet Ana.", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 322298, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 799}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:56:25.630000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Toledo, 25 years old, future architect, suffers from an acute jealousy.
