The blog describes her daily life honestly and accurately: her goals are as simple as a family trip to the Polish lake district; her planning as short-term as witnessing her son's first successful bike ride without training wheels. She starts the blog when she finds out she has cancer and is given three months to live. Then she promises her 5-year-old son, Jas, that she will do her best to survive for as long as possible. And she starts writing for him. The documentary shows the everyday existence of Joanna, her husband Piotr, and little Jas. It is as discreet as it is moving. Through few well-chosen words and observations it manages to be both essential and sensuous. A story of thoughtfulness in death, life and love.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2976354, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 210}, "languages": ["Polish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:10:17.077000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A story of thoughtfulness in death, life and love.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NzI0MDA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc3NzMwNDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1424390400000, "runtime": 40, "title": "Joanna", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442085842000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 3, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Aneta Kopacz (story)", "Aneta Kopacz", "Tomasz Sredniawa"], "year": 2013}
