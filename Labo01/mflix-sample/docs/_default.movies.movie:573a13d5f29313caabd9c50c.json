With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 2017038, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 53712}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:05:01.107000000", "metacritic": 87, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "After a collision with a shipping container at sea, a resourceful sailor finds himself, despite all efforts to the contrary, staring his mortality in the face.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MzIyMjU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk1MjQxMDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1383782400000, "runtime": 106, "title": "All Is Lost", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1436466471000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 12, "rating": 2.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["J.C.
