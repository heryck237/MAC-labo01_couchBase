His friends, Jen and Tim, witness the murder and help him cover it up. Four years later, Ray has never been arrested for the crime. Detective Charlie Schilling and his ex-partner, Ed Anderson, know that Ray did it. They just could never prove it. Charlie figures it's about time they did prove it. He's ready to push Ray harder than ever. Meanwhile, Ray has met his match in a new girl in town, Katherine Wallace. Kath is a bad girl; she and Ray are a potentially explosive combination. Throw in the fact that Ed is having a summer fling with Sally Richmond - a girl young enough to be his daughter. And Sally's just gotten a job at the motel that Ray manages. Ray has his eye on her. Charlie and Ed never found the gun that Ray used to murder the women at the campground. That rifle, as well as a handgun, are hidden behind the mirror in Ray's bathroom. Ray can only be pushed so far. The time will come when he takes the mirror off the wall and shows everyone who is in charge.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 451102, "rating": 6, "votes": 2157}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 03:38:15.787000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Hanging out at some campgrounds one nice summer day, 19-year-old Ray Pye decides to murder two young women.
