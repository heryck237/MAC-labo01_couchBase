At home, he holds conversations with his fish, who encourage him to do it. His supervisor picks on him. As he's screwing his courage to the sticking place, he drops a bullet; while on the floor looking for it, another colleague does exactly what Bob has been planning. Bob emerges a hero and the one colleague he likes, a woman with a bright smile, is severely wounded. Can Bob help her through despair and find himself and joy in life? Or, as everyone says, is this impossible for a man like him?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 760311, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 19982}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-09 00:14:46.990000000", "metacritic": 53, "plot": "An office worker inadvertently becomes a hero after he saves a woman's life.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMTI3NTkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUxMjU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1196985600000, "runtime": 95, "title": "He Was a Quiet Man", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 19, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1200355200000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1442080610000, "production": "Mitropoulos", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 19870, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.hewasaquietman.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Frank A.
