He is Fred West, who, with his wife Rosemary, is accused of killing their daughter and burying her in their garden at 25, Cromwell Street. West claims the death was accidental and his wife knew nothing of it. However grisly details gradually come to light and West owns to nine other murders, of girls who stayed at his house. Janet soon finds herself intimidated by the intensity of the situation, gutter press approaches to which her bi-polar husband succumbs and the foul-mouthed threats of Rosemary West. But just as disturbing is the rapport which Fred believes he has with her, terming her his only friend and confessing to her things he will not tell the police.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1831575, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1611}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:20:55.813000000", "plot": "Dramatisation of the case of serial killers Fred and Rose West, focusing on the way in which they were brought to justice.", "released": 1323475200000, "runtime": 180, "title": "Appropriate Adult", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1420743339000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 2, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2011}
