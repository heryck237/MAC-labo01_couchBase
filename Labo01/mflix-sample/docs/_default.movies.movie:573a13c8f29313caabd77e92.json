In three days, King and his followers will sacrifice the child at midnight. Milton picks up the trail in Oklahoma as well as rescuing a waitress named Piper from her brutal, two-timing fianc\u00e8. There are odd things about Milton: his driver's license is out of date, he has a very strange gun, and he's being pursued by a man in a suit who carries FBI ID and calls himself the Accountant. Piper, who's lived a life on the sidelines, has to piece things together on the fly as they close in on King.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 1502404, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 77741}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:09:39.310000000", "metacritic": 44, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A vengeful father escapes from hell and chases after the men who killed his daughter and kidnapped his granddaughter.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNTM4Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTAwNA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1298592000000, "runtime": 104, "title": "Drive Angry", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$10.7M", "consensus": "It may deliver the over-the-top action pieces, but Drive Angry prefers to work safely within grindhouse formula than do something truly unique.", "critic": {"meter": 45, "numReviews": 117, "rating": 5.3}, "dvd": 1306800000000, "fresh": 53, "lastUpdated": 1442140697000, "production": "Summit Entertainment", "rotten": 64, "viewer": {"meter": 37, "numReviews": 39935, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://www.driveangry3d.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Todd Farmer", "Patrick Lussier"], "year": 2011}
