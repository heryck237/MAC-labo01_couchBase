The resulting video sold more than 40,000 copies (she was never paid the agreed-upon $10,000). This documentary tells the story of that day and connects it to Chong's life as a student at USC and as the daughter of a middle-class Chinese couple in Singapore. Annabel talks to the camera about her decisions; the camera also follows her to an AIDS test after the world-record-setting sex fest and home to Singapore, where she visits her parents who do not know about her profession and friends and professors who do. Should she tell her mother?", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 181810, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 1241}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:32:44.377000000", "metacritic": 37, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "During a ten-hour period in January, 1995, porn actress Annabel Chong (1972- ) had sex with 251 men in front of cameras.
