We're introduced to the duo's lyrical and melodic craft when, for example, well-known actors recite Giants lyrics, underscoring the dark words often coupled with bright tunes. We also catch a glimpse of the band's ideas about performance from the blend of footage from concerts, television, music videos, and other media. Running through the whole film is a portrayal of the Johns' friendship and ultimately, their view of the world, which we see in interviews with the Giants themselves, their colleagues, and their fans.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 304081, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 656}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-06 00:40:32.727000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Documentary about the music group They Might Be Giants.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjIwNjE2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3MjQyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1015718400000, "runtime": 102, "title": "Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A clever, absorbing documentary about They Might Be Giants, a musical duo whose brainy, idiosyncratic brand of pop has earned them decades of cult success.", "critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 45, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1069113600000, "fresh": 37, "lastUpdated": 1434306682000, "production": "Cowboy Pictures", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 989, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.giganticfilm.com"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2002}
