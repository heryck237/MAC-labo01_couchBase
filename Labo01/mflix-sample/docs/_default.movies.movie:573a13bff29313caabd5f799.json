He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.", "genres": ["Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1130884, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 679494}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:01:13.263000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 395, "plot": "A U.S Marshal investigates the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhiNDkyNzktNTZmYS00ZTBkLTk2MDAtM2U0YjU1MzgxZjgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1266537600000, "runtime": 138, "title": "Shutter Island", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$125.0M", "consensus": "It may not rank with Scorsese's best work, but Shutter Island's gleefully unapologetic genre thrills represent the director at his most unrestrained.", "critic": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 241, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1275955200000, "fresh": 165, "lastUpdated": 1442078527000, "production": "Paramount Studios", "rotten": 76, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 2370270, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.shutterisland.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Laeta Kalogridis (screenplay)", "Dennis Lehane (novel)"], "year": 2010}
