In the village of Sainte-Philom\u00e8ne de Fortierville, Marie-Anne Caron, wife to T\u00e8l\u00e8sphore Gagnon, gives birth to their second daughter, Aurore. The child grows up in a loving and happy family, but in 1918 her mother dies of tuberculosis. Shortly after, T\u00e8l\u00e8sphore Gagnon decides to remarry, having fallen under the spell of his beautiful cousin, Marie-Anne Houde. Marie-Anne is not the devoted stepmother everyone takes her to be, however. Following the death of Aurore, a coroner's inquest reveals that the young girl had died of blood poisoning, brought on by the horrific abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepmother. The sensational trial which followed these revelations had a profound and lasting impact on Qu\u00e8bec society. Aurore depicts an almost-forgotten period and social milieu of Qu\u00e8bec's history, finally giving voice to those who, at the time, knew what was going on but preferred to remain silent.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 430895, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 964}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:47:23.130000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "After the sudden death of her mother, Aurore Gagnon is abused by her disturbed step-mother as her town remains in the silence followed by her death.
