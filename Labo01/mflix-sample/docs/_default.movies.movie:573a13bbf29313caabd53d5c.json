But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord, he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him--and it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia: incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both. All aboard the Pineapple Express.", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 910936, "rating": 7, "votes": 233620}, "languages": ["English", "Cantonese", "Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:05:05.603000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A process server and his marijuana dealer wind up on the run from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after he witness his dealer's boss murder a competitor while trying to serve papers on him.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MTE4NzAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3Mjg2MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1217980800000, "runtime": 111, "title": "Pineapple Express", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1206403200000, "lastUpdated": 1441995128000, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 156, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Seth Rogen (screenplay)", "Evan Goldberg (screenplay)", "Judd Apatow (story)", "Seth Rogen (story)", "Evan Goldberg (story)"], "year": 2008}
