The story was a perfect vehicle decades later to showcase the star quality of Esther Williams in the 1950s, and Kellerman's moniker was picked up by Life Magazine when it named Ms. Williams the \"Million Dollar Mermaid\" herself.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Musical"], "imdb": {"id": 44903, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 828}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:57:11.667000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Biopic of Australian swimming champ and entertainer Annette Kellerman.
