The film follows professional radical ecologist, Captain Paul Watson as he repeatedly flouts the law, so that he may apprehend what he sees as the more serious law-breakers: the illegal poachers of the world. Using verit\u00e8 sequences shot aboard his ship as a framing device, the documentary examines Watson's personal history as an activist through archival footage and interviews, while revealing the impact of this relentless pursuit on his personal life. From the genesis of Greenpeace to sinking a pirate whaling ship off Portugal, and from clashes with fisherman in the Galapagos to Watson's recent headline-grabbing battles with the Japanese whaling fleet in Antarctica, the film chronicles the extraordinary life of the most controversial figure in the environmental movement; the heroics, the ego, the urgency of the world's original eco-pirate.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1794779, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 207}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:12:26.660000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "\"Eco-Pirate\" tells the story of a man on a mission to save the planet and its oceans.
