These three men, who have nothing in common, all shared one thing: their love for Charlie. One loved her like a sister, one loved her like the woman of his dreams, one loved her like a friend. Except that Charlie is dead and none of them - not Boris, an accomplished businessman, not Elie, a night owl scriptwriter, and not Maxime, still living at home with his mother - know how to deal with it. But because she asked them to do so, they abruptly decide to undertake a journey together, heading for Corsica and the house that Charlie loved so much. Except that here they are stuck in a car together for over 500 miles. It's going to be a long journey. Boris, Elie and Maxime, three men, three generations, no affinity. But by the time they arrive at their destination, they will have realized one majorly important thing: Charlie has changed their lives forever.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 2112129, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 516}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-26 00:30:48.723000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Since Charlie is no longer there, the lives of Boris, Elie, and Maxime have been torn apart.
