In a distant town, she learns that the Mother Goose Theatre needs a leading lady. She applies; the manager tells her she lacks experience. She's not sure what that is, but sets out to get it. A cat who drives a milk truck provides Jennie with breakfast and a ride to a white house that's in need of a nanny; the catch is that if the nanny can't get the baby to eat, it's down to the basement where a lion resides. Can Jennie gain the experience she needs without becoming the lion's lunch? And, indeed, is there more to life, or in a land of lions and squalling babies, is there no place like home?", "genres": ["Animation", "Short", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1603847, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 153}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:55:30.267000000", "plot": "Jennie the terrier has everything a dog could ever wish for, but still feels that something is missing.
