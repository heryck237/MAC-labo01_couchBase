Made by dying Yilmaz Guney in France, after he escaped from a Turkish prison, enabling him to accept his award at Cannes for Yol (The Road). When the Turkish superstar leading man turned human rights activist, Guney was convicted for pro-Kurdish political activity and murder, by the Turkish military regime. Director/writer Guney's last film, Duvar (The Wall), was banned in Turkey for 17 years. The incarcerated teens organize and fight back, brutalize each other, exult over the smallest triumph, while joking, suffering and learning from the inhumanity they wallow in. The prison also separately houses men and women, many played by other Turkish expatriates.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 90982, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 2190}, "languages": ["Turkish", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-26 00:49:04.257000000", "plot": "Teens in a Turkish prison struggle to survive under hideous conditions.
