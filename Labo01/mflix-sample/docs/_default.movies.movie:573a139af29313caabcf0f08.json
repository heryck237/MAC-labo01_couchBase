They thrive on the no-room-for-error, fast-paced job and let it infect their lives. The undisputed king of pushing tin, \"The Zone\" Falzone, rules his workplace and his wedded life with the same short-attention span that gets planes where they need to be in the nick of time. That is, until Russell Bell, a new transfer with a reputation for recklessness but a record of pure perfection shatters the tensely-held status quo. The game of one-upmanship between the two flies so high as to lead Nick into Russell's bed with his wife. His sanity slipping just as fast as his hold on #1, Cusack's controller is thrown out-of-control when Thornton's wanderer quietly leaves town. Nick must now find a way to regain his sanity and repair his marriage before he breaks down completely.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 120797, "rating": 6, "votes": 24057}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 08:16:21.173000000", "metacritic": 47, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A feud develops between two air traffic controllers: one cocky and determined while the other is restrained and laidback, which inevitably affects their lives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNiMDdmNzUtOWE0MC00MjViLTkyOTctYTI0ZmUzOTU4ZTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 924825600000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Pushing Tin", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Solid performances by the leads, but the generic ending needs help.", "critic": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 66, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 997747200000, "fresh": 32, "lastUpdated": 1441913692000, "production": "Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment", "rotten": 34, "viewer": {"meter": 42, "numReviews": 33778, "rating": 2.9}, "website": "http://www.foxmovies.com/pushingtin"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Darcy Frey (article)", "Glen Charles (screenplay)", "Les Charles (screenplay)"], "year": 1999}
