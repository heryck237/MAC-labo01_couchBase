It is in this web of intrigue that they head for China, only after Walter discovers Kitty's infidelity with one dashing and witty diplomat Charlie Townsend. So much as to hide her from herself and to help thwart a cholera outbreak, this is a marriage more than on the rocks. This is a cold, indifferent and loveless partnership in a vast unknown and deadly environment that will test both these flightless lovebirds and with the hardships and tolerances more than any had ever anticipated. A visual delight amid the pain and suffering of a dying people and failing marriage. Will a cure be found for both, before it's too late?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 446755, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 73573}, "languages": ["Mandarin", "English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 03:59:26.700000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A British medical doctor fights a cholera epidemic in a small Chinese village, while being trapped at home in a loveless marriage to an unfaithful wife.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzODg4MjU4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDAzNTU3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1169164800000, "runtime": 125, "title": "The Painted Veil", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$7.9M", "consensus": "Visually, The Painted Veil has all the trappings of a stuffy period drama, but Norton's and Watts's deft portrayals of imperfect, complicated characters give the film a modern-day spark.", "critic": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 143, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1178582400000, "fresh": 106, "lastUpdated": 1439837306000, "production": "Warner Independent Pictures", "rotten": 37, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 54750, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://wip.warnerbros.com/paintedveil/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ron Nyswaner (screenplay)", "W.
