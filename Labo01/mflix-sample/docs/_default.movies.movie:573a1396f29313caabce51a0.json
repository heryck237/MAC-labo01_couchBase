Hart faces the rigors of his first year at Harvard Law School. The pressure to succeed is tremendous and some of the students form study groups while also spending a great many hours studying. Hart's greatest challenge is contract law and his professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. Using the Socratic method, Kingsfield challenges his students with questions demanding accuracy and creativity in their responses and often humiliating those who are unable to respond. As the school year progresses, Hart faces many challenges but befriends Susan Fields - unaware that she has a connection that affects their relationship. Finally, Hart accommodates himself to whatever might come his way, accepting a new set of priorities in his life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 70509, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 5287}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:37:01.670000000", "plot": "A first-year law student at Harvard Law School struggles with balancing his coursework and his relationship with the daughter of his sternest professor.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlhMTlhNWItODIxNC00Yjk5LTgzNjUtMDEyOWE2ZmJjNTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 119577600000, "runtime": 113, "title": "The Paper Chase", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 26, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1054512000000, "fresh": 22, "lastUpdated": 1440355549000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 4389, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["James Bridges", "John Jay Osborn Jr. (novel)"], "year": 1973}
