Michael Pemberton is a British Major, Fyodor Aleksandrovic Nazukov is a Soviet Sergeant and Peter Bradley is an American Lieutenant. A beautiful young Italian woman, Esperia Belli, agrees to give them shelter. She knows that despite Italy's efforts to break with Nazi Germany and join the Allies there are some Italians who are Fascist sympathizers and would gladly denounce Esperia to the German authorities. Hiding enemy soldiers or escaped POWs is punishable by death. Esperia hopes to get in contact with the Italian anti-Fascist resistance which could help the three escaped Allied POWs rejoin their respective armies. Until then, the fugitives are stuck in Esperia's attic.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 52781, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 406}, "languages": ["Italian", "German", "Russian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:20:31.003000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Three allied prisoners, a Russian, an American and an Englishman, attempt to escape with the help of a young couple from Rome.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MzU5OTIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4Nzk1MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -297302400000, "runtime": 82, "title": "Escape by Night", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sergio Amidei", "Diego Fabbri", "Brunello Rondi", "Roberto Rossellini"], "year": 1960}
