Although both have studied art, Kanao works as a shoe repairman which doesn't stretch his rather laid-back style and Shoko works in a small publishing firm. Their home life is marked by some clashes between her attempts at regimentation, including scheduling their sex life on a calendar, and his flirting with other women. Kanao is offered work as a courtroom sketch artist and becomes a witness to the most sensational murder trials of Japan through the next 8 years. He must cope with the ugliness and breakdown in civility he encounters. Shoko also re-discovers her artistic side as she confronts the dark side of life when struggling with depression over the loss of a child and the dysfunctional aspects of the lives of her mother and brother.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1245489, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 492}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:14:09.393000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "In 1993 Kanao and Shoko are a Tokyo couple awaiting the arrival of their first child.
