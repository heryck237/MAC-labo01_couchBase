Her sisters, and especially her Mother overshadow her with their beauty. She is a spiritual, superstitious and naive woman. She visits a psychic seer who tells her she must follow the sex trade in order to be happy. Not long after she meets her eccentric and sexy neighbour, Suzy, who, by all counts appears to be a high class prostitute and encourages Juilet into sexual acts which make her guilty and nervous. A rare night when her husband is at home she wakes up to catch him talking to another woman on the phone. He calls out the name \"Gabriella\" while sleeping, but when she questions him he lies his way out of it. She finds out who Gabriella is and fears her husband will leave her. Juliet begins having visions who accuse and terrorize her. The pinnacle of the visions comes at the end where it is implied she realizes she would be better off without her husband and is ultimately emotionally emancipated.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 59229, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 8025}, "languages": ["Italian", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:04:14.407000000", "metacritic": 81, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Visions, memories, and mysticism all help a 40-something woman to find the strength to leave her cheating husband.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U4OWQ3MjEtYTQ4Zi00MDY1LTg2YjgtNmJkNzI3MTM1YjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MTUwNTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -131328000000, "runtime": 137, "title": "Juliet of the Spirits", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 21, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 937267200000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1442336704000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 6453, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Federico Fellini (story)", "Tullio Pinelli (story)", "Federico Fellini (screenplay)", "Tullio Pinelli (screenplay)", "Ennio Flaiano (screenplay)", "Brunello Rondi (screenplay)"], "year": 1965}
