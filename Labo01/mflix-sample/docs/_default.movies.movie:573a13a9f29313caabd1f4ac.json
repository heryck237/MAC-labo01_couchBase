No one seems to be able to see him, except the mysterious man dressed in black. He eventually learns through their discussions that this man is a 19th century French aristocrat, who he coins the \"European\". This turn of events is unusual as the unseen man has a knowledge of the present day. The two quickly learn that they are in the Winter Palace of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the European who has a comprehensive knowledge of Russian history to his time. As the two travel through the palace and its grounds, they interact with people from various eras of Russian history, either through events that have happened at the palace or through the viewing of artifacts housed in the museum. Ultimately, the unseen man's desired journey is to move forward, with or without his European companion.", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 318034, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 12908}, "languages": ["Russian", "Persian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 02:07:51.593000000", "metacritic": 86, "plot": "A 19th century French aristocrat, notorious for his scathing memoirs about life in Russia, travels through the Russian State Hermitage Museum and encounters historical figures from the last 200+ years.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNDEwOTU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk0NTk5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1050710400000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Russian Ark", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$37.4k", "consensus": "As successful as it is ambitious, Russian Ark condenses three centuries of Russian history into a single, uninterrupted, 87-minute take.", "critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 99, "rating": 7.9}, "dvd": 1063065600000, "fresh": 88, "lastUpdated": 1441913335000, "production": "Wellspring Media", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 9208, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.russianark.spb.ru/eng/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Boris Khaimsky (dialogue)", "Anatoli Nikiforov", "Svetlana Proskurina (dialogue)", "Aleksandr Sokurov (dialogue)", "Aleksandr Sokurov"], "year": 2002}
