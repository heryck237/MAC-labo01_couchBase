With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads open their own day care facility, \"Daddy Day Care\", and employ some fairly unconventional and sidesplitting methods of caring for children. As \"Daddy Day Care\" starts to catch on, it launches them into a highly comedic rivalry with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director... who has driven all previous competitors out of business.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 317303, "rating": 5.5, "votes": 45539}, "languages": ["English", "Klingon", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:49:05.277000000", "metacritic": 39, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two men get laid off and have to become stay-at-home dads when they can't find jobs.
