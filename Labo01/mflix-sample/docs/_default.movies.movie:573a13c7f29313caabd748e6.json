In that time, there rises a magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against the backdrop, love-stories entwine: Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, the sadistic Lord William, Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone work and Ellen, the woman from the forest who casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age. Follett masterfully weaves these stories through political turmoil of 12th century England, creating a relevant and viable world for today's audience and for generations to come.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1453159, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 20130}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:15:46.230000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Set against a backdrop of war, religious strife and power struggles which tears lives and families apart.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NDgwNjQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU5MjI2Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-MA", "released": 1279843200000, "runtime": 60, "title": "The Pillars of the Earth", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442427324000, "viewer": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 9, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2010}
