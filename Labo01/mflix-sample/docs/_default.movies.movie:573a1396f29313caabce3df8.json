The organization's charismatic leader - the deputy - is scheduled to arrive in the town from the capital the day of the rally. Beyond the problems arranging the rally due to the probable incitement of violence at such a rally, the organization learns of an unconfirmed report that there will be an attempt on the deputy's life. The rally does happen, after which a three-wheeled kamikaze runs over the deputy, who eventually passes away from his injuries. The official report is that the incident was a drunken accident. In reality, the deputy's death was murder orchestrated by the secret police, the general for who likens the pacifist organization to mildew killing off agricultural crops. A magistrate is assigned to the case. Although he does have political views, he is more interested in finding out the truth, and as such has to wade through the political rhetoric and politically motivated testimony he hears. Thrown into the mix is a photojournalist who too is looking for the truth, as it, he believes, will make a great front page story.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 65234, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 16505}, "languages": ["French", "Russian", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:01:22.720000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Following the murder of a prominent leftist, an investigator tries to uncover the truth while government officials attempt to cover up their roles.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JjM2MwMDAtNGRhMi00MDZiLWIwMzYtYTZmMTc0MDU1ZWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "M", "released": -2073600000, "runtime": 127, "title": "Z", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Powerfully effective, this anti-fascist political thriller stands out as both high-conscience melodrama and high-tempo action movie.", "critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 39, "rating": 8.2}, "dvd": 1025568000000, "fresh": 37, "lastUpdated": 1442078785000, "production": "Rialto Pictures", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 6270, "rating": 4.3}, "website": "http://www.rialtopictures.com/z.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Vasilis Vasilikos (novel)", "Jorge Sempr\u00e8n"], "year": 1969}
