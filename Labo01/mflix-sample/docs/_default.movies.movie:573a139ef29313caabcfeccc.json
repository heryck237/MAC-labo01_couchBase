Barefoot, surviving monsoons, leeches, and machete-wielding villagers, he was rescued. Now, near 60, living on Mt. Tamalpais, Dengler tells his story: a German lad surviving Allied bombings in World War II, postwar poverty, apprenticed to a smith, beaten regularly. At 18, he emigrates and peels potatoes in the U.S. Air Force. He leaves for California and college, then enlistment in the Navy to learn to fly. A quiet man of sorrows tells his story: war, capture, harrowing conditions, escape, and miraculous rescue. Where did he find the strength; how does he now live with his memories?", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 145046, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4095}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 03:06:30.130000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "German-American Dieter Dengler discusses his service as an American naval pilot in the Vietnam War.
