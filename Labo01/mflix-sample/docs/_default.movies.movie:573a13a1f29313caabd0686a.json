Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his \"mother\", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 212720, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 222415}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:41:45.640000000", "metacritic": 65, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A highly advanced robotic boy longs to become \"real\" so that he can regain the love of his human mother.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWU2NzEyMDYtM2MyOS00OGM3LWFkNzAtMzRiNzE2ZjU5ZTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 993772800000, "runtime": 146, "title": "A.I.
