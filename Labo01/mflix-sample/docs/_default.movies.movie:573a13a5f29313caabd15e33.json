In days when an arrest equaled guilt and a conviction, his unfair imprisonment for horse thievery puts him steadfast, in the eyes of Victorian police, on the wrong side of things for life. With a sister unable to dissuade the unwanted advances of Constable Fitzpatrick, Ned, his brother Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart soon find themselves labeled \"an outlaw gang\" by the less-than-honorable constable. It's a designation they're apt to live up to after Ned's mother is unfairly arrested and sentenced to three years hard labor. In retaliation, the Kelly Gang strikes out against the oppressive Victorian government, with ultimately tragic results and passage into Australian folklore.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 277941, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 20400}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:00:39.870000000", "metacritic": 56, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An innocent man becomes one of the most wanted criminals the world has ever known.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmVjYzRkYjItODlmZS00OTEzLTliZjItYjMwOGRmMzhmY2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1080259200000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Ned Kelly", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "More depth about the legendary outlaw would be welcome, but as it is, Ned Kelly is a reasonably entertaining Western.", "critic": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 54, "rating": 5.7}, "dvd": 1090886400000, "fresh": 30, "lastUpdated": 1440355695000, "production": "Focus Features", "rotten": 24, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 41176, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.nedkellythemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert Drewe (novel)", "John Michael McDonagh (screenplay)"], "year": 2003}
