The film tells their story and that of four others who escaped with them and a teenage girl who joins them in flight. The group's natural leader is Janusz, a Pole condemned by accusations secured by torturing his wife; he knows how to live in the wilds. They escape under cover of a snowstorm: a cynical American, a Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who draws, a priest, and a Pole with night blindness. They face freezing nights, lack of food and water, mosquitoes, an endless desert, the Himalayas, and moral questions of when to leave someone behind.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 1023114, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 81379}, "languages": ["English", "Russian", "Polish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:56:34.930000000", "metacritic": 66, "plot": "Siberian gulag escapees travel 4,000 miles by foot to freedom in India.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5MTM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI2NzgwNA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1295568000000, "runtime": 133, "title": "The Way Back", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$2.7M", "consensus": "It isn't as emotionally involving as it should be, but this Peter Weir epic offers sweeping ambition and strong performances to go with its grand visual spectacle.", "critic": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 129, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1303430400000, "fresh": 96, "lastUpdated": 1442080873000, "production": "Newmarket Films LLC", "rotten": 33, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 33005, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Keith R.
