Pascale always acted as if she was the provider and head of the household, even now the inseparable brothers are twenty. But she started a secret affair with Flemish neighbor, cook Jan, whose ambition is to start a restaurant and B&B with her. As the boys learn she wants to cancel her job and sell the house for the project, college-man Thierry, who has a steady girl Anne, naturally refuses to let her spend dad's money meant for them. Gentler Fran\u00e8ois, content to remain a handyman, would consider letting her and maybe working in the 'family business'. This causes trouble, even after Pascale moves out to Gerda's indefinitely, leading to tragedy.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 855895, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 1351}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:40:54.953000000", "metacritic": 78, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Since Luc granted a divorce to Pascale ten years ago, he paid generous alimony and left a fine country house as long as their twin sons remain at home.
