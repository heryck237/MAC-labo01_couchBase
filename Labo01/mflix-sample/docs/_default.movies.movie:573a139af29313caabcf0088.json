Carly is a married woman with two kids, who works as the school secretary; Dinah is the single, lonely math teacher who coaches the girls' basketball team. Long time disinterest between the women perchance evolves in to a series of one-on-one basketball games, during which the two women grow closer physically and emotionally, until one heated game ends spontaneously in a kiss. The outcry from family, friends and the community as the relationship between these two women blooms, creates a timely story in which is woven the notion of family, of gay relationships and which raises the banner of gay marriage.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 116834, "rating": 6, "votes": 376}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:28:01.963000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "High School basketball coach, Dinah Groshardt, falls for the school secretary, Carly Lumpkin, and upsets the entire school in the process.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NjI1NzY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ5MjgwMzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 820454400000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Late Bloomers", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 20, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 4.5}, "dvd": 1064966400000, "fresh": 1, "lastUpdated": 1438540535000, "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 52, "numReviews": 819, "rating": 2.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Gretchen Dyer"], "year": 1996}
