After having spent many years in prison, he has a very concrete picture of what he wants out of life--including a nice home, a wife, and kids. As soon as he is able to assemble the pieces of this collage, by means of his chosen profession, he intends to retire and become a model citizen. In an effort to accelerate this process, he signs on to take down a huge score for a big-time gangster. Unfortunately, Frank's obsession for his version of the American Dream allows him to overlook his natural wariness and mistrust, when making the deal for his final job. He is thus ensnared and robbed of his freedom, his independence, and, ultimately, his dream.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 83190, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 13752}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:25:06.390000000", "metacritic": 78, "plot": "Becoming closer to his dream of leading a normal life, a professional safecracker agrees to do a job for the mafia, who have other plans for him.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVjMzVkODgtOTg1Mi00N2MyLTkzMDYtMTIzNzE3N2QwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 354499200000, "runtime": 122, "title": "Thief", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 27, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 989884800000, "fresh": 26, "lastUpdated": 1442511344000, "production": "MGM Home Entertainment", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 6681, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Frank Hohimer (novel)", "Michael Mann (screen story)", "Michael Mann (screenplay)"], "year": 1981}
