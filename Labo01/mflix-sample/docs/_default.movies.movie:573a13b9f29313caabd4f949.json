Confused, terrified and feeling still very much alive, Anna doesn't believe she's dead, despite the funeral director's reassurances that she is merely in transition to the afterlife. Eliot convinces her he has the ability to communicate with the dead and is the only one who can help her. Trapped inside the funeral home, with nobody to turn to except Eliot, Anna is forced to face her deepest fears and accept her own death. But Anna's grief-stricken boyfriend Paul (Long) still can't shake the nagging suspicion that Eliot isn't what he appears to be. As the funeral nears, Paul gets closer to unlocking the disturbing truth, but it could be too late; Anna may have already begun to cross over the other side.", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 838247, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 28797}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 00:00:25.727000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young woman caught between life and death... and a funeral director who appears to have the gift of transitioning the dead, but might just be intent on burying her alive.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDUzNTU5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE4ODIzMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1282780800000, "runtime": 104, "title": "After.Life", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "It has an interesting premise and admirable ambitions, but After.Life fails to deliver enough twists or thrills to sustain its creepy atmosphere.", "critic": {"meter": 26, "numReviews": 53, "rating": 4.5}, "dvd": 1280793600000, "fresh": 14, "lastUpdated": 1442079219000, "production": "Anchor Bay", "rotten": 39, "viewer": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 14318, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://www.afterlifethefilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo", "Paul Vosloo", "Jakub Korolczuk"], "year": 2009}
