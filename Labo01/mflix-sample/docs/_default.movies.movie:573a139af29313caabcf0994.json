He is plagued by severe neck pain. His father is bedeviled by water first leaking into his bedroom and then flooding the apartment; rain is incessant. Xiao-kang's mother is overcome by sexual longing for her son, sometimes making seemingly incestuous overtures. They try virtually every intervention for Xiao-kang's neck: Western medicine, a chiropractor, acupuncture, an herbal doctor, and a faith healer, Master Liu. Are the family's silent dynamics and Xiao-kang's neck pain connected? And what about the body floating in the Tamsui River: is everything dead?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 119263, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 1741}, "languages": ["Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-25 00:30:42.337000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "In Taiwan, Xiao-kang, a young man in his early 20s, lives with his parents in near silence.
