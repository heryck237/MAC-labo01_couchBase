To the rhythm of conveyor belts and immense machines, the film looks without commenting into the places where food is produced in Europe: monumental spaces, surreal landscapes and bizarre sounds - a cool, industrial environment which leaves little space for individualism. People, animals, crops and machines play a supporting role in the logistic of this system which provides our society's standard of living. OUR DAILY BREAD is a wide-screen tableau of a feast which isn't always easy to digest - and in which we all take part. A pure, meticulous and high-end film experience that enables the audience to form their own ideas.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 765849, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1950}, "languages": ["German", "Polish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:00:13.877000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "OUR DAILY BREAD is a wide-screen tableau of a feast which isn't always easy to digest - and in which we all take part.
