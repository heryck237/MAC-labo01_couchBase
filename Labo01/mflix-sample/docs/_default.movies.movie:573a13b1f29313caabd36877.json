Gustave Klimt (1862-1918) lies in hospital, dying. In reveries, he recalls the early 1900s: it's fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna. At the World Exposition in Paris, Klimt meets Georges M\u00e8li\u00e8s, who does a moving picture for him, and Klimt falls under the spell of a woman who may be Lea de Castro. We see Klimt in his studio; we meet his mother and sister, who suffer from mental illness. We watch Klimt the libertine. On his deathbed and as a younger man, he imagines things as well: encounters with ministers and waiters and with women who are willing participants in his pleasures. Is this the source of art?", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 417871, "rating": 5.1, "votes": 2212}, "languages": ["English", "German", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:07:42.157000000", "metacritic": 44, "plot": "A portrait of Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, whose lavish, sexual paintings came to symbolize the art nouveau style of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NzEyNDkwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUzNjA1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1141344000000, "runtime": 131, "title": "Klimt", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Klimt is handsomely filmed, but the blurred storyline and substandard performances prove its undoing.", "critic": {"meter": 32, "numReviews": 25, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1199750400000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1442513002000, "production": "Outsider Pictures", "rotten": 17, "viewer": {"meter": 29, "numReviews": 3703, "rating": 2.7}, "website": "http://www.klimtderfilm.at/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Raoul Ruiz", "Gilbert Adair (translation: English)", "Herbert Vesely (idea)"], "year": 2006}
