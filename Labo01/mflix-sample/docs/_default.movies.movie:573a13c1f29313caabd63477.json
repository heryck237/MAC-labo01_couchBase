Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the rooms of a love hotel, and on life at even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. And what of afterlife, is there more than a void?", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 1191111, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 38241}, "languages": ["English", "Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:24:36.987000000", "metacritic": 69, "plot": "A U.S. drug dealer living in Tokyo is betrayed by his best friend and killed in a drug deal.
