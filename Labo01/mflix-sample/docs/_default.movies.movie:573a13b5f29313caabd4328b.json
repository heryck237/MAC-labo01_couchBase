There, they find an old enemy has overtaken the great city with the help of Visorak--robotic spiders that can quickly encase anything or anybody in near-indestructible webs. The Toa undergo a bizarre metamorphosis while sealed within strange cocoons, and emerge as clunky-looking machines made up of mismatched parts. Though horrified, they find that they also possess some new powers, which prove essential for their subsequent journey to restore Metru Nui--and themselves. This delightful Bionicle installment is probably easily accessible for any viewer unfamiliar with the series to date.", "genres": ["Animation"], "imdb": {"id": 471588, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 631}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:06:18.250000000", "num_mflix_comments": 5, "plot": "The Toa Metru return to Metru Nui to rescue the remaining sleeping Matoran, only to find it overrun by the spider-like Visorak horde and its ruthless, sadistic rulers, Sidorak and Roodaka.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MTAwMjI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxNTAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-Y7", "released": 1128988800000, "runtime": 74, "title": "Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1128988800000, "lastUpdated": 1441908521000, "production": "Miramax", "viewer": {"meter": 59, "numReviews": 2568, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Henry Gilroy (story)", "Bob Thompson (story)", "Brett Matthews (screenplay)"], "year": 2005}
