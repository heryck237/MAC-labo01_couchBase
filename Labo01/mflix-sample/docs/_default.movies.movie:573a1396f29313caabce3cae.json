Lucius's grandfather gets the first automobile in the area, a bright yellow Winton Flyer. While he's away, the plantation handyman, Boon Hogganbeck, conspires to borrow the car, taking Lucius with him. Stowed away is Ned, a mulatto and Lucius's putative cousin. The three head for Memphis, where Boon's sweetheart works in a whorehouse, where Ned trades the car for a racehorse, and where Lucius discovers the world of adults - from racism and vice to possibilities for honor and courage. Is there redemption for reivers, rascals, and rapscallions?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 64886, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 1975}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:53:10.220000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In turn-of-the-century Mississippi, an 11-year-old boy comes of age as two mischievous adult friends talk him into sneaking the family car out for a trip to Memphis and a series of adventures.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2IwYTA0OWEtY2EyMC00MTY3LTljOTYtMTQwZDFiNDg3ZjRlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": -604800000, "runtime": 107, "title": "The Reivers", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1118707200000, "lastUpdated": 1440615719000, "production": "Viacom", "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 1104, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Faulkner (novel)", "Harriet Frank Jr.", "Irving Ravetch"], "year": 1969}
