The forger creates the paintings; Tom sells them. But another criminal business associate wants Tom to go in for an even riskier enterprise: murder. Tom suggests his associate ask a local picture framer instead. That man has a fatal disease, or so it's rumored. More, he has a wife and kid that surely he wouldn't want to leave penniless. Let this picture framer be a hit man, and no one will suspect. The terminally ill craftsman may agree to the misdeed, and several more, but he'll end up needing Tom Ripley in a pinch.", "genres": ["Crime", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 75675, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 7869}, "languages": ["German", "English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:49:46.007000000", "plot": "Tom Ripley, who deals in forged art, suggests a picture framer he knows would make a good hit man.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFlZDA1YTQtMGJjYy00OTVlLTkxODUtNTgxNWNiMTZkYmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 244252800000, "runtime": 125, "title": "The American Friend", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 17, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1041897600000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1442336771000, "production": "New Yorker Films", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 4613, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Patricia Highsmith (novel)", "Wim Wenders"], "year": 1977}
