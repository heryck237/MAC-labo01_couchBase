Here we get a rare glimpse behind the scenes into the real Champagne through six houses, from small independent producers to the illustrious houses of Gosset and Bollinger. In the vineyard, 2012 threatened to be 'the year of all our fears.' But most Champagne is not just the product of a specific year and its weather. Signature house styles are creations that happen behind closed doors and in the miles of cellars beneath Champagne. Pull back the curtain and see how the people of a cold, tough land with a grim history triumph in producing the drink of joy, seduction and celebration.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 3544048, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 76}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 00:44:09.450000000", "plot": "With renowned wine importer Martine Saunier as our guide, we get a rare glimpse behind the scenes into the real Champagne through six houses, from small independent makers to the illustrious houses of Gosset and Bollinger.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMTQzNTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4MDIwNDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1425600000000, "runtime": 82, "title": "A Year in Champagne", "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Kennard"], "year": 2014}
