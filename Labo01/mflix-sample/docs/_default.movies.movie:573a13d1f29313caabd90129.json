Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy (Bobby Cannavale) - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 1823664, "rating": 5.2, "votes": 19717}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:18:27.180000000", "metacritic": 33, "plot": "A foster kid, who lives with her mean foster mom, sees her life change when business tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNDYxOTI4MzNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ3MDU3NjIx._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1418947200000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Annie", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$85.9M", "consensus": "The new-look Annie hints at a progressive take on a well-worn story, but smothers its likable cast under clich\u00e8s, cloying cuteness, and a distasteful materialism.", "critic": {"meter": 27, "numReviews": 140, "rating": 4.5}, "dvd": 1426550400000, "fresh": 38, "lastUpdated": 1441905005000, "production": "Sony Pictures", "rotten": 102, "viewer": {"meter": 61, "numReviews": 51971, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.annie-movie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Will Gluck (screenplay)", "Aline Brosh McKenna (screenplay)", "Thomas Meehan (stage play book)", "Harold Gray (comic strip \"Little Orphan Annie\")"], "year": 2014}
