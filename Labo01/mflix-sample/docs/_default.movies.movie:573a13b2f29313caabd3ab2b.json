Wealthy and self-satisfied, Jean Hervey is returning home from work, describing life with his wife of 10 years, Gabrielle; he values her as impassive and stolid. However, that day she's gone, leaving a letter that she's joining a man she loves. Jean is devastated, but within minutes she's returned, telling him that her resolve has failed. Over the next two days, he questions, demands, begs, and parries with her: why did she leave, why did she return, does she love him, did she ever love him, who is her lover, is she passionate with her lover? She's calm as alabaster, reserved. Is she in danger? When she makes an offer, how will he respond?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 435479, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 1482}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-13 00:41:23.007000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The marriage between Gabrielle and Jean begins to fray after the discovery of a letter that belongs to Gabrielle.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIyNmQ4ZWQtYzQ0OC00MTkzLWJkZWQtZjliZTM5NzA0YTFmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1126224000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Gabrielle", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$89.7k", "consensus": "Patrice Ch\u00e8reau's exquisite rendering of Joseph Conrad's The Return brings underlying passions to surface in a long-suffering marriage.", "critic": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 53, "rating": 6.7}, "dvd": 1166486400000, "fresh": 40, "lastUpdated": 1437850003000, "production": "IFC First Take", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 16668, "rating": 2.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Patrice Ch\u00e8reau", "Anne-Louise Trividic", "Joseph Conrad (novel)"], "year": 2005}
