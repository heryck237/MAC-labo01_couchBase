The group is as diverse as the city: there's a young man on drugs, an arguing couple, a woman with prayer beads and a girl who has just fallen in love, and behind the wheel sits the chatty driver. As the bus emerges from a tunnel, everything is suddenly quite still: the streets and buildings are all empty and there's not a soul to be seen; it's as if everyone has suddenly been swallowed by the earth. Only the millions of neon lights continue to blink, as if nothing has happened. The eclectic group of passengers seek refuge in a deserted caf\u00e8 and discuss what they should do. Then they make a horrific discovery.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Mystery", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 3504824, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 773}, "languages": ["Cantonese", "Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 01:08:42.650000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A night like any other in the streets of Hong Kong: in the midst of the tangle of night-owls, cars and vendors, a group of passengers climb aboard a minibus that is to take them from ...", "released": 1397088000000, "runtime": 124, "title": "The Midnight After", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Fai-Hung Chan (screenplay)", "Fruit Chan (screenplay)"], "year": 2014}
