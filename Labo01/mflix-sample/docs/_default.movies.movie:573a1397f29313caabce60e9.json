Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 74605, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 3317}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:45:49.327000000", "metacritic": 80, "plot": "A filmed account of a bitterly violent miner strike.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlhZGQ3MmEtMjZkNi00NTM5LThlY2YtMzQxMmQ0NjFmZDg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 244252800000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Harlan County U.S.A.", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 8, "rating": 9.2}, "dvd": 1145923200000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1440613737000, "production": "Cinema 5 Distributing", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 2761, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "year": 1976}
