At the school, classrooms freeze, teachers come and go, resources are scant. When a popular teacher is suspended, a few students protest. Jackson, a new security guard, gets tough. In a scuffle, Jackson's wounded with his own gun and a student takes him hostage. A few kids join in, for various reasons. An ineffective policewoman tries to mediate as the police plan an assault, the kids demand improvements to the school, the media pick up the story, and Jackson turns sympathetic. But are too many forces in motion for the students to stay in control?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 172726, "rating": 6, "votes": 3051}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:47:04.423000000", "metacritic": 43, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A group of teens is bent on improving the run-down conditions of their high-school.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODc3NTQxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc2NjcxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 942192000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Light It Up", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Soon into the student uprising, the story starts to feel like a warmed over after-school special.", "critic": {"meter": 38, "numReviews": 48, "rating": 4.8}, "dvd": 960854400000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1440961449000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 30, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 6722, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.foxmovies.com/lightitupcs.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Craig Bolotin"], "year": 1999}
