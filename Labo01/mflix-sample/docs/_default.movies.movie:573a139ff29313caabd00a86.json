Chief among the purveyors of this literature was Bob Mizer, who maintained a magazine and developed sexually inexplicit men's films for over 40 years. Aided by his mother, the two maintained a stable of not so innocent studs. At the end, the film moves into a court room drama as Mizer is tried for running a male-prostitute ring in the early 60's. Clips of Mizer's actual films starring individuals, such as Jack LaLanne and Joe Dallesandro, are included.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 187712, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 809}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-18 00:20:18.897000000", "metacritic": 52, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "This film looks at the 1950's muscle men's magazines and the representative industry that were popular supposedly as health and fitness magazines, but were in reality primarily being ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY5NzJjNzYtMmRhYi00MGQ2LWE4ZDUtOTNhZTYzMDBkMzI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 939859200000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Beefcake", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 5.4}, "dvd": 976579200000, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1441132760000, "production": "Strand Releasing", "rotten": 3, "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 1230, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Thom Fitzgerald"], "year": 1998}
