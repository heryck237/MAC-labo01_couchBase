In 1938, Gandhi's party is making inroads in women's rights. Chuyia, a child already married but living with her parents, becomes a widow. By tradition, she is unceremoniously left at a bare and impoverished widows' ashram, beside the Ganges during monsoon season. The ashram's leader pimps out Kalyani, a young and beautiful widow, for household funds. Narayan, a follower of Gandhi, falls in love with her. Can she break with tradition and religious teaching to marry him? The ashram's moral center is Shakuntala, deeply religious but conflicted about her fate. Can she protect Kalyani or Chuyia? Amid all this water, is rebirth possible or does tradition drown all?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 240200, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 11832}, "languages": ["Hindi", "Sanskrit"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:13:44.120000000", "metacritic": 77, "plot": "The film examines the plight of a group of widows forced into poverty at a temple in the holy city of Varanasi.
