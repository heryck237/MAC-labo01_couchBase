However, his task is a race against time, for peace may come at any time, and if it comes before the amendment is passed, the returning southern states will stop it before it can become law. Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the war.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 443272, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 182438}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:01:01.983000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzczMDUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2ODEzOA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1353024000000, "runtime": 150, "title": "Lincoln", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$182.2M", "consensus": "Daniel Day-Lewis characteristically delivers in this witty, dignified portrait that immerses the audience in its world and entertains even as it informs.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 250, "rating": 8}, "dvd": 1364256000000, "fresh": 224, "lastUpdated": 1442081441000, "production": "Dreamworks Pictures", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 243774, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.thelincolnmovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tony Kushner (screenplay)", "Doris Kearns Goodwin (book)"], "year": 2012}
