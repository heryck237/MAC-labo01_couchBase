Marie, who's slight and diffident, quiet and nearly expressionless, is friends with Anne, who's a bit chunky and impulsive and has decided that Fran\u00e8ois will be her first love. Watching synchronized swimming, Marie is suddenly attracted to the team captain, Floriane, beautiful, aloof, tall, and rumored to be a slut. Fran\u00e8ois pursues her. Marie begins to hang around her; they trade favors, and soon it's an odd sort of friendship. Each of the three experiences her own first, and Marie must sort out attraction and friendship.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 869977, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 6588}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:07:58.927000000", "metacritic": 65, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Summer in a new suburb outside Paris.
