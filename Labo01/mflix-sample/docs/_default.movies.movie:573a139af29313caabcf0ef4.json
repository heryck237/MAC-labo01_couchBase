Street-wise and tough, an ex-marine, he is betrayed by a one-time partner, and shot in the back by his junkie wife. He survives and returns, looking to recover his share from the robbery of an Asian crime gang. The money has passed into the hands of \"the Outfit\", a slick gangster organisation that runs the city. He has to make his way through a world populated by heroin dealers, prostitutes, sado-masochists, gunmen and crooked cops, a place where torture is a way of life. His only friend is a former employer, a prostitute, and her loyalty is in question, given she now works for the Outfit. He makes good early progress, but then falls into the hands of Fairfax, the crime boss.", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 120784, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 105779}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:15:35.930000000", "metacritic": 46, "plot": "Porter is shot by his wife and best friend and is left to die.
