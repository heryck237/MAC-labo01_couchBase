They end up spending time in the most unusual manner ...discussing literature, prose and career trajectories ...gradually divulging little insights into their own selves as we start to understand the old journalist's cynicism and the young prot\u00e8g\u00e8's intentions.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1760980, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 848}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:23:16.407000000", "metacritic": 61, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two characters: old and young; teacher and pupil; man and woman.
