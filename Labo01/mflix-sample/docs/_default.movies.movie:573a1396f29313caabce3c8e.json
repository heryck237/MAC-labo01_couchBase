In a motel room where Natalie stops to rest during the day, she sits motionless on the bed, and experiences the exuberance of complete freedom and the queasy feelings of new beginnings. Natalie continues on with her journey and picks up a young hitch-hiker -Killer (James Caan), an attractive brain-damaged football player. It is through Killer that poses a more disturbing question to Natalie than that of domestic responsibility. How deeply are we wedded to chance meetings and are we responsible for the crimes that we witness?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 64873, "rating": 7, "votes": 1949}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:39:11.693000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "Having discovered that she is pregnant, Natalie Ravenna (Shirley Knight), a Long Island housewife panics and leaves home to see if she might just possibly have made something different out ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM3OWVjOGQtODRiYi00MTFmLWFmNmUtMDcxNDgxZWFhMjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": -10972800000, "runtime": 101, "title": "The Rain People", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 11, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1245628800000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1440615711000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 741, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Francis Ford Coppola"], "year": 1969}
