He finds that in the seedy world of snuff films. He interviews Vic, a seasoned pro with a menacing, mysterious dark side. Miles becomes obsessed with the subject matter and his subject. Miles' primary investor, Carl, is also very interested, more in the hypnotic allure of the movies and potential for profit. As Miles tapes his interviews with Vic he becomes aware of the appearance of \"ghosts\" captured on his video monitor. He realizes that the faint energy fields of these ghosts, past victims of the snuff films, are picked up more readily on video. As a ghost becomes more powerful they become more visible to the naked eye. He soon realizes that Vic is in league with the Devil and delivers the souls of his victims to attain more power.", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 867295, "rating": 3.5, "votes": 202}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:47:18.463000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A documentary filmmaker finds himself drawn into the seedy world of a snuff filmmaker with a mysterious dark side.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNzYyMDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY4NTI3MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1206403200000, "runtime": 84, "title": "From a Place of Darkness", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1249948800000, "lastUpdated": 1439749915000, "viewer": {"meter": 13, "numReviews": 119, "rating": 2.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Scott Kenyon Barker (screenplay)", "Douglas A.
