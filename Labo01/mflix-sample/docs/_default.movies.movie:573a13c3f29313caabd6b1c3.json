He lives with a doting mother, subservient brother, and a father who covers his expenses and credit card bills. Sid takes his college finals then starts work at his father's business; he lasts less than a week before walking out. At a graduation party, he meets Aisha, newly arrived from Calcutta and set on becoming a writer. He shows her the city and helps her refurbish a rented flat. He asks if she'd like to progress from friend to something more, but she says no: he lacks ambition and isn't her type. Will her words, his exam results, a confrontation with his parents, and a break with his friends be enough to wake Sid up?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1324059, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 14973}, "languages": ["Hindi", "English", "Bengali"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:15:14.343000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A spoiled young adult living in Mumbai experiences a change in his lazy ways when he meets a woman at a party, who inspires him to \"wake up\".", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc1ZDBkODMtYjI0MC00NDcyLWFhMGUtYzM4NDQyMzgyYzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1254441600000, "runtime": 138, "title": "Wake Up Sid", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.6M", "dvd": 1262563200000, "lastUpdated": 1439749215000, "production": "UTV", "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 5132, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://wakeupsid.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ayan Mukherjee (story)", "Niranjan Iyengar (dialogue)"], "year": 2009}
