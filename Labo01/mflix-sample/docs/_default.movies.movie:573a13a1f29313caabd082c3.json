Gig, his seedy pal, advises him to run an insurance scam; when it goes awry, Russ is out another $10,000 and in trouble with Dale, a bat-wielding thug. Gig convinces Russ to rig the state lottery with the help of Crystal, a gold-digging ditz with a heart of tin. They have to find a beard to buy the ticket, and then they have to cash it. Soon, murder and various double-crosses add to Russ's nightmare. A lazy cop zeroes in. Jail is closer than riches. Will Russ have to choose between his money and his life?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 219952, "rating": 5, "votes": 8232}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:14:50.480000000", "metacritic": 31, "plot": "A television weatherman scams a local lottery.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZjYyZDMtYWYyOC00ZGNjLWIyMmEtYTViZGQyNjRhMTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 972604800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Lucky Numbers", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$9.5M", "consensus": "Nora Ephron's attempt at dark comedy is an uneven product, both in terms of the direction and the acting.
