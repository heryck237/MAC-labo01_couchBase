Her husband, G\u00e8rard, a businessman and philanderer, hates the campaign and feels vindication when a nasty leaflet circulates about their family history. His son, Fran\u00e8ois, just back from the U.S., is in love with his step-sister Mich\u00e8le, and she with him, although something is amiss besides their being cousins. Watching it all is their elderly Aunt Line, who has her own haunting memories. A death in World War II and a death on election night collapse time in the perpetual present and bring unexpected expiation. There's a lot to celebrate.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 322289, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 2512}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:58:09.490000000", "metacritic": 67, "plot": "Three generations of a wealthy Bordeaux family are caught in the crossfire when Anne decides to run for mayor, thanks to a political pamphlet that revives an old murder scandal.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA1ODJmY2ItOWNiMC00MjA0LWE4NTYtMWU3NGQzNTlmMDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1045612800000, "runtime": 104, "title": "The Flower of Evil", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 60, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1082419200000, "fresh": 39, "lastUpdated": 1430248945000, "production": "Palm Pictures", "rotten": 21, "viewer": {"meter": 48, "numReviews": 1180, "rating": 3.1}, "website": "http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/flowersofevil.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Caroline Eliacheff (original scenario)", "Louise L.
