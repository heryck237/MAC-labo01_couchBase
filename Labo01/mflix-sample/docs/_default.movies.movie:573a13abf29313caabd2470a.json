Updated to current times, moved out of the poor house and onto the streets, the tale is told from the point of Dickens' character, Artful Dodger--now Dodge. The prosaically beautiful Oliver falls into the hands of down-and-out young men. Dodge takes the young man under his wing and instructs him in the unforgiving arts of drug abuse and prostitution. As Oliver's innocence dissolves, both young men confront inner and outer demons and, strangely, it is Dodge who finds he cannot escape his past.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 339827, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 1083}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 00:43:47.743000000", "metacritic": 39, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A queer \"Oliver Twist\" update set in the hustler district of modern-day Toronto.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDY3NDMyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY3MDYyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1127865600000, "runtime": 97, "title": "Twist", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Despite of its contemporary setting and some strong performances, this is a bland retelling of Oliver Twist.", "critic": {"meter": 16, "numReviews": 31, "rating": 4.4}, "dvd": 1098144000000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1435948533000, "production": "Strand Releasing", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 1548, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.christalfilms.com/officialsites/twist"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Charles Dickens (novel)", "Jacob Tierney"], "year": 2003}
