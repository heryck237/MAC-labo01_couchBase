When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and \"Let's Hear It for the Boy\".", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 87277, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 46558}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:53:02.620000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A city teenager moves to a small town where rock music and dancing have been banned, and his rebellious spirit shakes up the populace.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE2NjQ1MjQtOTdmNi00NjJmLWJlYTItNmFhYzBmMWM4NTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 445824000000, "runtime": 107, "title": "Footloose", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dean Pitchford"], "year": 1984}
