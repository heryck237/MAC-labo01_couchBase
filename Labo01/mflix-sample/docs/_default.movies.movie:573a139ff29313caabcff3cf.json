John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that \"might\" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.", "genres": ["Action", "Mystery", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 181689, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 369160}, "languages": ["English", "Swedish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:02:16.007000000", "metacritic": 80, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI3YzZjZjEtMDdjOC00OWVjLTk0YmYtYzI2MGMwZjFiMzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1024617600000, "runtime": 145, "title": "Minority Report", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$131.9M", "consensus": "Thought-provoking and visceral, Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci-fi thriller.", "critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 239, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1040083200000, "fresh": 216, "lastUpdated": 1442078941000, "production": "Dreamworks", "rotten": 23, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 478637, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.minorityreport.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Philip K.
