We meet a wide range of characters - from spoiled rich brats to real bottom-feeding criminal scum, and everyone in-between. In the best traditions of Commedia dell'arte, the characters each have easily recognizable roles - although there are a few twists to throw the audience off and keep things fresh. The story revolves around a few odd coincidences and a ****load of bad decisions, which all result in a really messed-up Friday. It starts out innocently enough with jokes, fun and a bit of alcohol, but given the level of intellectual capacity in our leading characters, you can see the train wreck coming. And when some drugged out punks - who have a rather tenuous relationship with reality during best of days - go all Clockwork Orange on an opera loving cankerous old man, it can only end up in tears (and blood, guts and bit of rather literal toilet humour as well).", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 2106744, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 418}, "languages": ["Estonian"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-03 01:28:32.140000000", "plot": "At an ever-accelerating pace, this thriller / dark comedy tells the story of 8 very different groups whose paths cross in the space of 24 hours.
