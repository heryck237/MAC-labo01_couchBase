The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 20629, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 44514}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German", "Latin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:10:14.427000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg2MWQ4MDEtOGZlNi00MTg0LWIwMjQtYWY5NTQwYmUzMWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg2MzE2OTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": -1242000000000, "runtime": 136, "title": "All Quiet on the Western Front", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Director Lewis Milestone's brilliant anti-war polemic, headlined by an unforgettable performance from Lew Ayres, lays bare the tragic foolishness at the heart of war.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 40, "rating": 8.9}, "dvd": 915494400000, "fresh": 39, "lastUpdated": 1440355218000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 17424, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Erich Maria Remarque (by)", "Maxwell Anderson (adaptation)", "George Abbott (screen play)", "Del Andrews (adaptation)", "C.
