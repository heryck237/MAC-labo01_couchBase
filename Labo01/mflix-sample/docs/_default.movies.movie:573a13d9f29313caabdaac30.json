For ten-year-old Frederike (10) October 1989 gets off to a disastrous start: her beloved Uncle Mike (27) is expelled from the GDR and has to leave the country within 48 hours. Inspired by her big idol Captain Kirk, Frederike and her friends Jonathan (10) and Fabian (10) construct a teleporting machine to \"beam\" herself to West Berlin to visit her uncle Mike. But the experiment dramatically fails. Instead of successfully beaming the three kids across, the entire village population disappears! For a moment it seems that Frederike and her friends are the last remaining kids on earth. But TV proves what Frederike had immediately suspected: they have managed to beam everybody but themselves to West Berlin. They witness on TV how their families and friends desperately try to climb back over the Wall to their home country. Only quick thinking and action can undo the experiment and prevent the worst from happening before the border guards open fire. A race against time and the nasty local policeman Mauder begins.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Family"], "imdb": {"id": 2270802, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 80}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:42:15.697000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An adventurous story about the \"real\" happenings of November 9, 1989 in Germany, the day the wall came down!
