The film also details life under Israeli military rule, the role of the United States in the conflict, and the major obstacles that stand in the way of a lasting and viable peace. Unlike any other film produced on the conflict, 'Occupation 101' explains the complicated reality with precision storytelling through a series of highly stylized visual edits, and gives audiences a complete context with which to better understand the Israeli-Palestinian debate. The roots of the conflict are explained with thought-provoking commentaries from leading Middle East scholars, peace activists, journalists, religious leaders and humanitarian workers whose voices have too often been suppressed in American media outlets.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 807956, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 1479}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 01:14:10.647000000", "plot": "A thought-provoking and powerful documentary film on the current and historical root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and U.S. political involvement.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA4MDg3NzAyNTNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA0OTUxNzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1179187200000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Occupation 101", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1399248000000, "lastUpdated": 1442259110000, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 509, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Abdallah Omeish", "Sufyan Omeish", "Alison Weir (narration)"], "year": 2006}
