She encounters a strange waif-like girl, Cenci, who bears a strong resemblance to her lost child. Cenci is herself struck by the great resemblance of Leonora to her own mother, whose death the mentally unstable Cenci has been unable to accept or even acknowledge. The two women quickly develop a symbiotic relationship, moving in and out of the illusion that each is the lost loved one of the other. The complicating factor is the arrival of Albert, Cenci's stepfather, whose incestuous attachment to her may well be the cause of her mind's unbalance. With Albert's arrival, no one in the strange trio is safe.", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 63571, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 1194}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:46:04.977000000", "plot": "A penniless woman meets a strange girl who insists she is her long-lost mother, and becomes enmeshed in a web of deception, and perhaps madness, in this powerful psychological thriller.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk0YWY2YzgtYWU5Yi00ZmExLWE3MDktOGUxOTAzNGZlZmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0MzMzNjA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": -37584000000, "runtime": 109, "title": "Secret Ceremony", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 10, "rating": 5.8}, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1438540833000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 460, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marco Denevi (short story \"Ceremonia secreta\")", "George Tabori"], "year": 1968}
