He meets his match in Marion, an American, 19, who's available but refuses any romantic illusions. At first, her candor and cynicism put him off, but after he witnesses her breaking up with her rocker boyfriend, he's attracted to her and invites her on an idyllic two-week trip to France. Slowly, she pokes holes in his artifice and he comes to care for her. When they return to London, with the press thinking they're married, they come to a cross-roads: go back to their old lives, marry each other, or invent a new, open relationship.
