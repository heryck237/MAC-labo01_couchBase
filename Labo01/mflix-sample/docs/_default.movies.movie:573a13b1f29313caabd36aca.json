He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a half-way house for recently paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightening. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution's spring.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 418455, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 31563}, "languages": ["Danish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:40:15.880000000", "metacritic": 51, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A neo-nazi sentenced to community service at a church clashes with the blindly devotional priest.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NTc5NjM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyMTE0MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1113523200000, "runtime": 94, "title": "Adam's Apples", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Good and evil collide with interesting results in Adam's Apples, a dark Biblical allegory that's alternatively funny and shocking.", "critic": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 36, "rating": 6.2}, "dvd": 1199750400000, "fresh": 25, "lastUpdated": 1439921202000, "production": "Outsider Pictures", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 8344, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.adamsaebler.dk/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Anders Thomas Jensen"], "year": 2005}
