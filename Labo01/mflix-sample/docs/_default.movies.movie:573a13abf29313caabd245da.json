His name is Ramon, an apparently normal man in his forties, who seems to be quite harmless. Gagged and bound to a chair, Laura realises that it's the same person who kidnapped her and who is now pacing in the shadows. Ramon continues to speak as he turns off the television. He walks over to her, takes off the gag and challenges Laura to play the \"Word Game\". If she wins, she gets to go free, but if she loses, he'll poke out her eye. Laura is terrified, but reluctantly accepts. The game begins. Laura makes a mistake. Ramon menacingly moves towards her. Laura's screams are useless.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 339489, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1755}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-03 00:32:43.147000000", "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "A mild-mannered psychopath plays mind-games with a woman he has tied to a chair in his basement.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjc2NTg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc0NDMzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1051660800000, "runtime": 89, "title": "Palabras encadenadas", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1121126400000, "lastUpdated": 1440096108000, "production": "LionsGate Entertainment", "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 1204, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jordi Galceran (play)", "Laura Ma\u00e8\u00e8", "Fernando de Felipe"], "year": 2003}
