They shoot and wound him, but he gets away. They pursue, led by the dour Carver, who will pay them each $1 a day once he's captured. The hunted is Gideon, resourceful, skilled with a knife. Gideon's flight and Carver's hunt require horses, water, and bullets. The course takes them past lone settlers, a wagon train, a rail crew, settlements, and an Indian philosopher. What is the reason for the hunt; what connects Gideon and Carver? What happened at Seraphim Falls?", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 479537, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 23354}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:52:22.863000000", "metacritic": 62, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "At the end of the Civil War, a colonel hunts down a man with whom he has a grudge.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNTcyODE4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3ODM0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1176422400000, "runtime": 115, "title": "Seraphim Falls", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.3M", "consensus": "A brutal, slow-moving drama that unfolds among some great-looking scenery.", "critic": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 82, "rating": 5.7}, "dvd": 1179187200000, "fresh": 45, "lastUpdated": 1442267861000, "production": "Samuel Goldwyn Films", "rotten": 37, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 10811, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/seraphimfalls/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Von Ancken", "Abby Everett Jaques"], "year": 2006}
