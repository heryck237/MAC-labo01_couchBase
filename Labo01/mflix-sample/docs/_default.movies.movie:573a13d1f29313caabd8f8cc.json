Two 15-year-old girls, two dysfunctional families. Absolute opposites and yet somehow similar. No one listens, no one hears.

Opposites attract. Ari is a blonde who paints herself up like a canary, Oona loves things as black as night. Their unlikely friendship helps them survive the hypocrisy of their families. Ari finally gains some kind of self-respect, and Oona learns to give vent to her pain. Then something happens that threatens their friendship at its very roots....
