This film can be seen as a paranoid 1950s warning against those Damn Commies or, conversely, as a metaphor for the tyranny of McCarthyism (or the totalitarian system of Your Choice) and has a pro- and epilogue that was forced upon Siegel by the studio to lighten the tone.", "genres": ["Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 49366, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 31771}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:01:34.433000000", "plot": "A small-town doctor learns that the population of his community is being replaced by emotionless alien duplicates.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTExYjM3MDYtMzg4MC00MjU4LTljZjAtYzdlMTFmYTJmYTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -438825600000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "One of the best political allegories of the 1950s, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an efficient, chilling blend of sci-fi and horror.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 48, "rating": 9}, "dvd": 898819200000, "fresh": 47, "lastUpdated": 1440526681000, "production": "Republic Pictures Home Video", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 18475, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Daniel Mainwaring (screenplay)", "Jack Finney (Collier's magazine serial)"], "year": 1956}
