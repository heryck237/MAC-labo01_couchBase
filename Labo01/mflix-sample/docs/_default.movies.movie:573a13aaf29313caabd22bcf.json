When the desperately insecure and emotionally inarticulate John breaks up with Deirdre to 'give her a little test' his plan backfires leaving her broken-hearted and him alone and miserable. Through chance and coincidence, their break-up triggers a roller coaster ride of interweaving escapades in the lives of everyone around them. Intermission presents a slice of life, the passage between breaking up and making up, exploring how our lives intersect, and the power we all possess to affect the lives of those around us.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 332658, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 13174}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:24:40.023000000", "metacritic": 64, "plot": "A variety of losers in Dublin have harrowingly farcical intersecting stories of love, greed and violence.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjQzNzYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg0MzUyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1082073600000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Intermission", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.8M", "consensus": "An edgy and energetic ensemble story.", "critic": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 96, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 1098144000000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1440011963000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 26, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 10305, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://www.intermission-movie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark O'Rowe"], "year": 2003}
