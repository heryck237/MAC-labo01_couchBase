In the 1930s, Adam Fenwick-Symes is part of the English idle class, wanting to marry the flighty Nina Blount. He's a novelist with a hundred-pound advance for a manuscript confiscated by English customs. He spends the next several years trying to get money and to set a wedding date: he trades in gossip, wins money on wagers then gives it to a drunken major who's suggested he bet on a horse in an upcoming race. Adam tries to get the money back, but can't find the major. Meanwhile, Nina needs security, friends drink too much, and general unhappiness spoils the party. Then war breaks out. Is Adam's bright youth dimming with the fall of an empire?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 325123, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 4198}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:08:36.027000000", "metacritic": 64, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel \"Vile Bodies,\" is a look into the lives of a young novelist, his would-be lover, and a host of young people who beautified London in the 1930s.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxZTcwODUtZDUyYi00ZGNhLWIxYTYtNjcwNDY3MzZkYzljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1065139200000, "runtime": 106, "title": "Bright Young Things", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.8M", "consensus": "Colored with witty performances and a camp sense of satire, Stephen Fry's version of Evelyn Waugh's novel may only be fitfully successful but it does mark a promising debut for the British comic.", "critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 109, "rating": 6.3}, "dvd": 1107820800000, "fresh": 71, "lastUpdated": 1440183437000, "production": "ThinkFilm", "rotten": 38, "viewer": {"meter": 68, "numReviews": 6379, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.brightyoungthingsthemovie.co.uk/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Stephen Fry (screenplay)", "Evelyn Waugh (novel)"], "year": 2003}
