When their beloved dad falls into a coma, they hatch a plan to revive him using a positive emotional shock - giving him a grandchild. They find a surrogate mom through Craig's list - she's Janine, a penniless local musician, with a large, intimidating boyfriend, James. The pregnancy gives the Solomons nine months to learn to be parents. In a side story, John pursues Tara, a neighbor who takes care of their dad when John and Dean are out; but she has no interest in John. Can the boys keep Janine and James happy, keep dad alive, and learn to be dads?", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 784972, "rating": 5.3, "votes": 9128}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:48:57.763000000", "metacritic": 32, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A pair of well-meaning, but socially inept brothers try to find their perfect mates in order to provide their dying father with a grandchild.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzUwNzcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM3MTg0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1189123200000, "runtime": 93, "title": "The Brothers Solomon", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.9M", "consensus": "Squandering its impressive cast with poorly-directed gags, The Brothers Solomon is a one-joke film stretched well beyond its limits.", "critic": {"meter": 15, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 3.3}, "dvd": 1198627200000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1442511301000, "production": "Screen Gems", "rotten": 61, "viewer": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 56419, "rating": 2.6}, "website": "http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thebrotherssolomon"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Will Forte"], "year": 2007}
