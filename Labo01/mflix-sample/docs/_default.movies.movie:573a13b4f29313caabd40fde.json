He's desperate for money, so, against the backdrop of Nixon's reelection calculations, Irving claims he has Howard Hughes's cooperation to write Hughes's autobiography. With the help of friend Dick Suskind, Irving does research, lucks into a manuscript written by a long-time Hughes associate, and plays on corporate greed. He's quick-thinking and outrageously bold. Plus, he banks on Hughes's reluctance to enter the public eye. At the same time, he's trying to rebuild his marriage and deflect the allure of his one-time mistress, Nina Van Pallandt. Can he write a good book, take the money, and pull off the hoax?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 462338, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 14097}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:18:58.443000000", "metacritic": 70, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In what would cause a fantastic media frenzy, Clifford Irving sells his bogus biography of Howard Hughes to a premiere publishing house in the early 1970s.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkxNmFhY2QtYjI5Yy00NDA0LTgzYmUtY2Y0NjVjYWUwY2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1177027200000, "runtime": 116, "title": "The Hoax", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1190678400000, "lastUpdated": 1442520364000, "viewer": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 119, "rating": 3.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Wheeler (screenplay)", "Clifford Irving (book)"], "year": 2006}
