In 1958, the body of Eva Szalanczky, a political journalist, is discovered near the border. Her friend Livia is in hospital with a broken neck; Livia's husband, Donci, is under arrest. In a flashback to the year before, we see what leads up to the tragedy. Eva gets a job as a writer. She meets Livia and is attracted to her. Livia feels much the same, but as a married woman, has doubts and hesitations. In their work, they (and Eva in particular) bang up against the limits of telling political truths; in private, they confront the limits of living out sexual and emotional truth.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 83872, "rating": 7, "votes": 463}, "languages": ["Hungarian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:42:59.770000000", "plot": "Political and sexual repression in Hungary, just after the revolution of 1956.
