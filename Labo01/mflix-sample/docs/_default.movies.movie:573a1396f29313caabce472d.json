His life revolves around his work and socialising with colleagues along with his wife, Dolan (Paromita Chaudhuri). His sister-in-law, Tutul (Sharmila Tagore) comes to stay with them for a few days. She is given a tour of the life they lead - in restaurants, beauty parlours, clubs and race courses. But then crisis strikes in the form of agitation at the factory just before the shipment of a prestigious export order and Shyamalendu is held to blame. With the help of a shady labour officer, Shyamalendu averts the crisis by declaring a lock-out at the factory after staging a false riot. For his 'efficient' handling of the crisis, Shyamalendu is promoted and there is congratulations all around - except from Tutul, who has understood the vacuousness of Shyamalendu's world and has hated it. Shyamalendu is left successful and desolate - at the top.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 67729, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 604}, "languages": ["Bengali"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-19 00:45:19.480000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Chatterji is an ambitious and self-made young man who becomes the director of the company he works for.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNDE3Njk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA1NDA1NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 54518400000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Company Limited", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1266192000000, "lastUpdated": 1430937093000, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 102, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Manisankar 'Sankar' Mukherjee (novel)", "Satyajit Ray (screenplay)"], "year": 1971}
