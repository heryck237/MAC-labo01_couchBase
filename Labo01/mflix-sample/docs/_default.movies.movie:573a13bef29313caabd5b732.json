Carl and Robert, two slacker best friends who smoke hashish as a way of cheerful living - have been peddling hashish for a decade, hitting an all time high with this last batch: 45 Kilos of pure, high grade Nepalese Hashish destined for the draught-dry Oslo streets. In their own eyes they are not criminals they simply provide the life-essential drug to a suffering population. But then Glenn comes along, their friend and ambitious financial-backer-destined-to-be-a-yuppie. He has plans to make this deal even bigger than they have been led to believe. Following the delivery of the hashish, the police are on their tail for heroin-smuggling a fact they cannot explain as they both hate heroin and would never touch the drug. Finally they both awake from their self-induced haze, and fight back in a hilarious, suspenseful and dramatic ending.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1054116, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 1310}, "languages": ["Norwegian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 01:20:42.680000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "1979 is ending, the 80s are approaching rapidly.
