Compelled by the staggering amount of power that the MPAA ratings board wields, the filmmaker seeks out the true identities of the anonymous elite who control what films make it to the multiplex. He even goes so far as to hire a private investigator to stake out MPAA headquarters and expose Hollywood's best-kept secret. Along the way, Dick speaks with numerous filmmakers whose careers have been affected by the seemingly random and sexual-content obsessed judgments of the MPAA, including John Waters, Mary Harron, Darren Aronofsky, Kevin Smith, Matt Stone, and Atom Egoyan.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 493459, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 24228}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:42:58.283000000", "metacritic": 75, "plot": "Kirby Dick's expos\u00e8 about the American movie ratings board.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDIwMDUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3MzIzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NC-17", "released": 1157068800000, "runtime": 98, "title": "This Film Is Not Yet Rated", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A fascinating and entertaining film that will open many eyes to the often-questioned tactics of the MPAA and their ratings sytem.", "critic": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 117, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1169510400000, "fresh": 98, "lastUpdated": 1441131240000, "production": "IFC Films", "rotten": 19, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 30751, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.ifc.com/thisfilmisnotyetrated/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kirby Dick", "Eddie Schmidt", "Matt Patterson"], "year": 2006}
