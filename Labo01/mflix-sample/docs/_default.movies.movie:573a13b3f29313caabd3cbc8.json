Arabs volunteer to fight Nazis to liberate France, their motherland. We follow Sa\u00e8d, dirt poor, an orderly for a grizzled sergeant, Martinez, a pied noir with some willingness to speak up for his Arab troops; Messaoud, a crack shot, who in Province falls in love with a French woman who loves him back; and Abdelkader, a corporal, a budding intellectual with a keen sense of injustice. The men fight with courage against a backdrop of small and large indignities: French soldiers get better food, time for leave, and promotions. Is the promise of liberty, equality, and fraternity hollow?", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 444182, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 11681}, "languages": ["French", "Arabic"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-30 00:59:15.460000000", "metacritic": 82, "plot": "During WWII, four North African men enlist in the French army to liberate that country from Nazi oppression, and to fight French discrimination.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTEzMDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzA0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1159315200000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Days of Glory", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.2M", "consensus": "Days of Glory is a powerful historical epic that pays homage to a valiant group of soldiers whose sacrifices have largely been forgotten.", "critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 85, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1181606400000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1440530447000, "production": "The Weinstein Company", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 10172, "rating": 3.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Rachid Bouchareb", "Olivier Lorelle"], "year": 2006}
