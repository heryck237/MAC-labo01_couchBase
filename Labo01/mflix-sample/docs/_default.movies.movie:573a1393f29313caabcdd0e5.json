Al Stephenson returns to an influential banking position, but finds it hard to reconcile his loyalties to ex-servicemen with new commercial realities. Fred Derry is an ordinary working man who finds it difficult to hold down a job or pick up the threads of his marriage. Having had both hands burnt off during the war, Homer Parrish is unsure that his fianc\u00e8e's feelings are still those of love and not those of pity. Each of the veterans faces a crisis upon his arrival, and each crisis is a microcosm of the experiences of many American warriors who found an alien world awaiting them when they came marching home.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 36868, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 36573}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 01:24:38.307000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Three WWII veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2RmNTRjYzctODI4Ni00MzQyLWEyNTAtNjU0N2JkMTNhNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PASSED", "released": -711417600000, "runtime": 172, "title": "The Best Years of Our Lives", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "An engrossing look at the triumphs and travails of war veterans, The Best Years of Our Lives is concerned specifically with the aftermath of World War II, but its messages speak to the overall American experience.", "critic": {"meter": 98, "numReviews": 46, "rating": 8.6}, "dvd": 878169600000, "fresh": 45, "lastUpdated": 1442510353000, "production": "RKO Radio Pictures", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 10304, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert E.
