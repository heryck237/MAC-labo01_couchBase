They'd served 65 years for a murder they didn't commit, framed by a local sheriff while buying moonshine whiskey for a Manhattan club owner to whom they owed money. In flashbacks we see this odd couple thrown together (Ray is a fast-talking con man, and Claude is a serious man about to start work as a bank teller), the loss of Ray's watch (sterling silver, from his daddy), the murder and trial, the hardships of Parchman, and the love-hate relationship of Claude and Ray as they spend 65 years bickering and looking for a way to escape.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 123964, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 31786}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:03:08.420000000", "metacritic": 63, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The story of two criminals (Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence) who discover the value of life after being sentenced to life imprisonment.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M0YWM1OTgtMDY1Ni00Y2RkLTkxNzktODUyNDU0YWFkYjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 924220800000, "runtime": 108, "title": "Life", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Entertaining if not over-the-top humor from a solid comic duo provides plenty of laughs.", "critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 54, "rating": 5.7}, "dvd": 940291200000, "fresh": 27, "lastUpdated": 1442080360000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 27, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 49949, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.universalpictures.com/life"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert Ramsey", "Matthew Stone"], "year": 1999}
