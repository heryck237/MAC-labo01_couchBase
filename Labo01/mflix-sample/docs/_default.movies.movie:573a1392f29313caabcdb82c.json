The production tends to glorify the young male body and, some say, expresses the Nazi attitude toward athletic prowess. Miss Riefenstahl captures the grace of athletes during field hockey, soccer, bicycling, equestrian, aquatic and gymnastic events. Highlights are the Pentathlon and the Decathlon, which was won by American Glenn Morris; it ends with the triumphant conclusion of the games.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 30523, "rating": 8, "votes": 1971}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:59:28.093000000", "plot": "The document of the 1936 Olympics at Berlin, orchestrated as Nazi propaganda.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAxZTk0NmItOTA2NS00MDczLWI3MzktMzk0NzA0OTdjNThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -939168000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Olympia Part Two: Festival of Beauty", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442336596000, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 249, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Leni Riefenstahl"], "year": 1938}
