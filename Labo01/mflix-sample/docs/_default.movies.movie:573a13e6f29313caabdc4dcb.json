Peter is ten years old boy in the midst of turbulent Soviet Ukraine. His father, American engineer, is killed for obtaining secret documents about repressions, which now are hidden in Peter's book. Boy flees from police with a blind Kobzar (Ukrainian folk minstrel), Ivan Kocherga. Ivan does everything to help his young guide to grow up and survive with a kind and clear soul that will not be hardened by what his eyes have seen.
