A group of young soldiers is brought in as a relief for the battle-weary Marines. The exhausting fight for a strategically-positioned airfield that allows control over a 1000-mile radius puts the men of the Army rifle company C-for-Charlie through hell. The horrors of war form the soldiers into a tight-knit group; their emotions develop into bonds of love and even family. The reasons for this war get further away as the world for the men gets smaller and smaller until their fighting is for mere survival and the life of the other men with them.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 120863, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 130364}, "languages": ["English", "Tok Pisin", "Japanese", "Greek"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:40.317000000", "metacritic": 78, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Terrence Malick's adaptation of James Jones' autobiographical 1962 novel, focusing on the conflict at Guadalcanal during the second World War.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEzMTM2NjAtNWFmZC00MTVlLTgyMmQtMGQyNTFjZDk5N2NmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ1ODk3MTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 916358400000, "runtime": 170, "title": "The Thin Red Line", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "The Thin Red Line is a daringly philosophical World War II film with an enormous cast of eager stars.", "critic": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 91, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 941500800000, "fresh": 72, "lastUpdated": 1442164421000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 19, "viewer": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 147416, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.foxmovies.com/thinredline"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["James Jones (novel)", "Terrence Malick (screenplay)"], "year": 1998}
