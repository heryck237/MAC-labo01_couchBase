However, this means destroying one of the villages in his kingdom. Meanwhile, Yzma is hatching a plan to get revenge and usurp the throne. But, in a botched assassination courtesy of Yzma's right-hand man, Kronk, Kuzco is magically transformed into a llama. Now, Kuzco finds himself the property of Pacha, a lowly llama herder whose home is ground zero for the water park. Upon discovering the llama's true self, Pacha offers to help resolve the Emperor's problem and regain his throne, only if he promises to move his water park.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 120917, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 114178}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:20:49.450000000", "metacritic": 70, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Emperor Kuzco is turned into a llama by his ex-administrator Yzma, and must now regain his throne with the help of Pacha, the gentle llama herder.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1ZDcwY2YtMzRhZi00OTYwLTkzMmYtMGMwN2Y3ZjM1MTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 976838400000, "runtime": 78, "title": "The Emperor's New Groove", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$87.3M", "consensus": "The Emperor's New Groove isn't the most ambitious animated film, but its brisk pace, fresh characters, and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 127, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 988675200000, "fresh": 108, "lastUpdated": 1442078149000, "production": "Buena Vista Pictures", "rotten": 19, "viewer": {"meter": 83, "numReviews": 448587, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/emperorsnewgroove"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Chris Williams (story)", "Mark Dindal (story)", "David Reynolds (screenplay)", "Stephen J.
