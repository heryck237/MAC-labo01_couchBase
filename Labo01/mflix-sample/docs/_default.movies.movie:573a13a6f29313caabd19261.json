One of his victims is promising dancer Bhanu (Revathi) who vows never to dance again till his death following a public affront by Neelakandan and his cronies. Ironically they fall in love. Meanwhile, the vicious Shekaran (Napoleon) of a rival clan has sworn to avenge the death of his uncle, killed by Neelakandan's men.
