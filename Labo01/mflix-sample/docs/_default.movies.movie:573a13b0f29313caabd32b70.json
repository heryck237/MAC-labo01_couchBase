Twenty filmmakers have five minutes each; the audience must weave a single narrative out of twenty moments. The 20 moments are fused by transitional interstitial sequences and also via the introduction and epilogue. Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film, extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment, preparing the audience for a surprise, and providing a cohesive atmosphere. There's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life. A common theme of Paris and love fuses all.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 401711, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 60536}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Spanish", "Mandarin", "Arabic"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:31:20.060000000", "metacritic": 66, "plot": "Through the neighborhoods of Paris, love is veiled, revealed, imitated, sucked dry, reinvented and awakened.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MDgwNDE4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQzMzc0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1181865600000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Paris, je t'aime", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$4.9M", "consensus": "Paris Je T'aime is uneven, but there are more than enough delightful moments in this omnibus tribute to the City of Lights to tip the scale in its favor.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 112, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1194912000000, "fresh": 97, "lastUpdated": 1440270334000, "production": "First Look Pictures", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 84, "numReviews": 191962, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.firstlookstudios.com/pjt/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Tristan Carn\u00e8 (original idea)", "Emmanuel Benbihy (concept)", "Emmanuel Benbihy (transitions)", "Bruno Podalyd\u00e8s (segment)", "Paul Mayeda Berges (segment)", "Gurinder Chadha (segment)", "Gus Van Sant (segment)", "Joel Coen (segment)", "Ethan Coen (segment)", "Walter Salles (segment)", "Daniela Thomas (segment)", "Christopher Doyle (segment)", "Rain Li (in collaboration with)", "Gabrielle Keng (in collaboration with)", "Isabel Coixet (segment)", "Nobuhiro Suwa (segment)", "Sylvain Chomet (segment)", "Alfonso Cuar\u00e8n (segment)", "Olivier Assayas (segment)", "Oliver Schmitz (segment)", "Richard LaGravenese (segment)", "Vincenzo Natali (segment)", "Wes Craven (segment)", "Tom Tykwer (segment)", "Gena Rowlands (segment)", "Alexander Payne (segment)", "Nadine E\u00e8d (segment)", "Fr\u00e8d\u00e8ric Auburtin (transitions)"], "year": 2006}
