While observing the legal proceedings, the Holocaust survivor concludes that Eichmann was not a simple monster, but an ordinary man who thoughtlessly buried his conscience through his obedience to the Nazi Regime and its ideology. Arendt's expansion of this idea through her resulting New Yorker articles would create the concept of the \"Banality of Evil\" that she thought even sucked in some Jewish leaders of the era into unwittingly participating in the Holocaust. The result is a bitter public controversy in which Arendt is accused of blaming the Holocaust's victims. Now, that strong willed intellectual is forced to defend her daringly innovative ideas about moral complexity in a struggle that will exact a heavy personal cost.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1674773, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 6413}, "languages": ["German", "English", "French", "Hebrew", "Latin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:44:14.640000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A look at the life of philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt, who reported for The New Yorker on the war crimes trial of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMDM2NTUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ2NzAzOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1357776000000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Hannah Arendt", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.7M", "consensus": "Led by a powerful performance from Barbara Sukowa, Hannah Arendt does a commendable job of dramatizing the life of a complex public figure.", "critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 64, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 1384819200000, "fresh": 56, "lastUpdated": 1441303699000, "production": "Zeitgeist Films", "rotten": 8, "viewer": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 3395, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/hannaharendt/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Pamela Katz (screenplay)", "Margarethe von Trotta (screenplay)", "Pamela Katz"], "year": 2012}
