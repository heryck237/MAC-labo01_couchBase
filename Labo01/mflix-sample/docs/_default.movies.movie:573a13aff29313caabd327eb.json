Less than twenty years later, the Argentinians have lost literally everything: major national companies have been sold well below value to foreign corporations; the proceeds of privatizations have been diverted into the pockets of corrupt officials; revised labour laws have taken away all rights from employees; in a country that is traditionally an important exporter of foodstuffs, malnutrition is widespread; millions of people are unemployed and sinking into poverty; and their savings have disappeared in a final banking collapse. The film highlights numerous political, financial, social and judicial aspects that mark out Argentina's road to ruin.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 400647, "rating": 8, "votes": 783}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-24 00:32:00.210000000", "plot": "After the fall of the military dictatorship in 1983, successive democratic governments launched a series of reforms purporting to turn Argentina into the world's most liberal and prosperous...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMjM2NTU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE0MjA0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1079568000000, "runtime": 120, "title": "Social Genocide", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 7}, "fresh": 4, "lastUpdated": 1438976145000, "production": "Ad Vitam", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 517, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Fernando E.
