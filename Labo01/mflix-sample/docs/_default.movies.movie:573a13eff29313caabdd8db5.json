Each lost in their everyday lives, Meira (Hadas Yaron), a Hasidic Jewish wife and mother and F\u00e8lix (Martin Dubreuil), a Secular loner mourning the recent death of his estranged father, unexpectedly meet in a local bakery in Montreal's Mile End district. What starts as an innocent friendship becomes more serious as the two wayward strangers find comfort in one another. As F\u00e8lix opens Meira's eyes to the world outside of her tight-knit Orthodox community, her desire for change becomes harder for her to ignore, ultimately forcing her to choose: remain in the life that she knows or give it all up to be with F\u00e8lix. Giroux's film is a poignant and touching tale of self-discovery set against the backdrops of Montreal, Brooklyn, and Venice, Italy.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 3685218, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 389}, "languages": ["French", "Yiddish", "English", "Spanish", "Hebrew", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-14 00:54:05.363000000", "metacritic": 66, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "In F\u00e8lix and Meira, an unusual romance blossoms between two lost souls who inhabit the same neighborhood but vastly different worlds.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjY3Mjk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYzODE1NDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1429228800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Felix and Meira", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Maxime Giroux", "Alexandre Laferri\u00e8re"], "year": 2014}
