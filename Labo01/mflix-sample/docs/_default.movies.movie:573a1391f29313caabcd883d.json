The film's legendary reputation is due to the astonishing range of techniques that Gance uses to tell his story, culminating in the final twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple- image montages projected simultaneously on three screens.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 18192, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 5064}, "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:07:08.593000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A film about the French Field Marshal's youth and early military career.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY4M2ZlMGQtMzM4ZC00YjdhLTkxOGQtNTU4NjZhY2IwNmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -1289779200000, "runtime": 240, "title": "Napoleon", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 8.7}, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1439749061000, "production": "Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 1543, "rating": 4.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Abel Gance"], "year": 1927}
