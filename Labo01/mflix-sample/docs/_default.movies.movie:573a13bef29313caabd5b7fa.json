Suddenly they come face-to-face with Indians, naked apart from their paint, with self-made weapons at the ready. The tourists sail on excitedly. The Indians put on their jeans and collect their daily wages. The Guarani, one of Brazil's oldest Indian communities, are forced to live in a reservation. A small group of Guarani decide to leave the reservation and settle in a traditional territory that has belonged to white men for several generations. The clash between two conflicting cultures is conceived as a suspense story with mystical elements. The actors are real Indians with no actor training.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1054674, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 673}, "languages": ["Portuguese", "Guarani", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-18 00:02:07.033000000", "plot": "When a tribe of indigenous Guarani Indians attempts to re-inhabit their ancestral land, which lies on the border of a wealthy landowner's fields, tensions escalate.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNzc4MTU3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ4MTEwMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1227830400000, "runtime": 104, "title": "Birdwatchers", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 6.9}, "fresh": 23, "lastUpdated": 1440357073000, "production": "01 Distribution", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 306, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.birdwatchersfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marco Bechis", "Luiz Bolognesi", "Lara Fremder (collaborator)"], "year": 2008}
