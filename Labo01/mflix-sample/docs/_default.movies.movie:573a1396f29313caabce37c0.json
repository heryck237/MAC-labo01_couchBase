In the staid and stifling environment of a post-World War II army post in France, Callan's deeply repressed attraction to other men surfaces when he encounters handsome Private Swanson. Maintaining the rugged \"man's man\" image of a war hero, Callan barks orders to his underlings. Later, lonely in his solitude, he recalls the frightening experiences of war and the events that led to this crossroads. Filled with self-loathing and unable to act on the natural attraction he feels for Swanson, Callan's affection festers into antagonism. He pushes Swanson constantly with verbal assaults and undeserved punishments. Oblivious to Callan's attraction to him, Swanson comes finally to feel enmity for his Master Sergeant.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 63585, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 380}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:15:11.727000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A story of a brilliant master sergeant with a great career behind him and transferred to yet another post, his attraction to a younger man eventually overrides him, to a point where his latent homosexuality, finally emerges.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE0NWI5MjYtZWI3NC00YzgxLTgwMWEtYTk4YTJmMzQyYWEwL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MDQ1Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": -32140800000, "runtime": 108, "title": "The Sergeant", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1440614995000, "viewer": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 14, "rating": 2.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dennis Murphy (screenplay)", "Dennis Murphy (novel)"], "year": 1968}
