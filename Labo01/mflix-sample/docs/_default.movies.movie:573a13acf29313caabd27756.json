His early movie fame was based primarily on his comic characterizations, often of bumbling and foreign-accented persons, characters which he embodied. As his movie fame rose, he began to lose his own personal identity to his movie characters, leading to self-doubt of himself as a person and a constant need for reassurance and acceptance of his work. This self-doubt manifested itself in fits of anger and what was deemed as arrogance by many. In turn, his personal relationships began to deteriorate as his characterizations were continually used to mask his problems. His first wife, Anne Howe, left/divorced him and his relationships with his parents and children became increasingly distant. His relationship with his second wife, Swedish actress Britt Ekland, was based on this mask. In his later life, he tried to rediscover himself and his career with what would become his penultimate film role, that of Chance in Being There (1979).", "genres": ["Biography", "Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 352520, "rating": 7, "votes": 12545}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:29:04.833000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The feature adaptation of Roger Lewis' book about the actor best remembered as Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTA1NTAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMzcyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1096588800000, "runtime": 122, "title": "The Life and Death of Peter Sellers", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 21, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1115683200000, "fresh": 16, "lastUpdated": 1441994947000, "production": "Home Box Office", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 8780, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.petersellersthemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Roger Lewis (book)", "Christopher Markus (teleplay)", "Stephen McFeely (teleplay)"], "year": 2004}
