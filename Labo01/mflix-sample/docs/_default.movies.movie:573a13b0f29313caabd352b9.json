He dreams of taking it to the Bonneville Salt Flats to see how fast it will go. By the early 1960s, heart disease threatens his life, so he mortgages his house and takes a boat to Los Angeles, buys an old car, builds a makeshift trailer, gets the Indian through customs, and heads for Utah. Along the way, people he meets are charmed by his open, direct friendliness. If he makes it to Bonneville, will they let an old guy on the flats with makeshift tires, no brakes, and no chute? And will the Indian actually respond?", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 412080, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 41733}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:03:04.657000000", "metacritic": 68, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The life story of New Zealander Burt Munro, who spent years building a 1920 Indian motorcycle -- a bike which helped him set the land-speed world record at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats in 1967.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MjA0MDA3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU0MjMzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1143158400000, "runtime": 127, "title": "The World's Fastest Indian", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$5.0M", "consensus": "Overcomes its formulaic storyline thanks to Anthony Hopkins' warm and endearing portrayal of an age-defying thrill seeker.", "critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 140, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1110844800000, "fresh": 115, "lastUpdated": 1440096824000, "production": "Magnolia Distribution", "rotten": 25, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 35464, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.worldsfastestindian.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Roger Donaldson"], "year": 2005}
