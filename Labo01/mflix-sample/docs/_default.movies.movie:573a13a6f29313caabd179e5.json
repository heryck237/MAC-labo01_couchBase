They had a powerful effect on me. You should see them.\" That's Martin Scorsese's message for this documentary. We meet his family on Elizabeth Street in New York; he's a third generation Italian with Sicilian roots. Starting in 1949, they watched movies on TV as well as in theaters, lots of Italian imports. Scorsese, with his narration giving a personal as well as a public context, shows extended clips of these movies. Films of Rossellini and De Sica fill part one; those of Visconti, Fellini, and Antonioni comprise part two. Scorsese takes time with emotion, style, staging, technique, political context, and cinematic influence. It's his movie family.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 173772, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 2254}, "languages": ["English", "Italian", "French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 02:32:07.700000000", "metacritic": 90, "plot": "World-renowned director Martin Scorsese narrates this journey through his favorites in Italian cinema.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NDg3NjY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE0MTk2NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1021507200000, "runtime": 246, "title": "My Voyage to Italy", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 1089072000000, "fresh": 20, "lastUpdated": 1435860325000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 2867, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Suso Cecchi D'Amico", "Raffaele Donato", "Kent Jones", "Martin Scorsese"], "year": 2001}
