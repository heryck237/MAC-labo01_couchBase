Every seven years, Michael Apted re-interviews those willing (two declined this time). At 42, careers are stuck or flourishing; marriages are strong, shaky, or over (and Bruce recently married for the first time). They're dealing with parents' dying, and children coming-of-age. One is a single mom with young sons. One is remarried, but how are the five children from his first marriage? Lyn and Jackie face health problems with down-to-earth lucidity. Neil, on the margin at 28 and 35, has a glorious story of friendship at 42.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 164312, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 1752}, "languages": ["English", "Latin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:06:03.440000000", "metacritic": 86, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Director Michael Apted revisits the same group of British-born adults after a 7 year wait.
