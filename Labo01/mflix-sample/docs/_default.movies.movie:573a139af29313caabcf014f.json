Upon arrival, they see that her claims are true - but Michael is not what they expected: he smokes, drinks beer, has a very active libido and has a rather colourful vocabulary. In fact, they would never believe it were it not for the two feathery wings protruding from his back. Michael agrees to travel to Chicago with the threesome, but what they don't realise is that the journey they are about to undertake will change their lives forever.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 117038, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 33722}, "languages": ["English", "Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:50:07.273000000", "metacritic": 38, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two tabloid reporters checking out a report of the Archangel Michael living with an old woman find that it's true.
