In addition to these irritating surface details, there is also his parent's cherished mechanisms of manipulation and guilt. Confused by this love/hate relationship that obsesses him more and more each day, Hubert drifts through the mysteries of adolescence - artistic discoveries, illicit experiences, the opening-up to friendship, and ostracism. The turbulent relationship between mother and son unfolds with a compelling combination of savage fury and melting affection. The stunning, semi-autobiographical directing debut of 20-year-old actor Xavier Dolan.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1424797, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 14278}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:41:07.533000000", "metacritic": 83, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A semi-autobiographical story about Hubert as a young homosexual at odds with his mother.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MDg0OTE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1OTIxMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1247616000000, "runtime": 96, "title": "I Killed My Mother", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 21, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 1376352000000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1438717584000, "production": "Kino Lorber Films", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 2814, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.ikilledmymother.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Xavier Dolan (screenplay)", "Xavier Dolan (dialogue)"], "year": 2009}
