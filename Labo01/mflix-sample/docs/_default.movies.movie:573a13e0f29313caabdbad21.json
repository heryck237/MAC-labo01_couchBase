Realistic and witty, Berlin filmmaker Cueneyt Kaya shows the rapprochement of two worlds which seem violently opposed. 'I always wanted to tell a story set in the Islamic culture in Germany from a realistic, critical and humorous perspective. Too often stories about Muslims and migrants are reduced to Taliban, headscarves, youth violence, and several other stereotypes. The world I grew up in, however, is entirely different. Its determined by family ties, caring for each other and the struggle you face if you want to maintain your identity as a Muslim of Turkish origin in Western society.'
