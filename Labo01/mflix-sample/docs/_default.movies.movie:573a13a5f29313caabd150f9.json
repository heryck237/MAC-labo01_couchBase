It's one of several vignettes of Palestinian life in Israel - in a neighborhood in Nazareth and at Al-Ram checkpoint in East Jerusalem. Most of the stories are droll, some absurd, one is mythic and fanciful; few words are spoken. A man who goes through his mail methodically each morning has a heart attack. His son visits him in hospital. The son regularly meets a woman at Al-Ram; they sit in a car, hands caressing. Once, she defies Israeli guards at the checkpoint; later, Ninja-like, she takes on soldiers at a target range. A red balloon floats free overhead. Neighbors toss garbage over walls. Life goes on until it doesn't.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 274428, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 2801}, "languages": ["Arabic", "Hebrew", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 12:55:55.323000000", "metacritic": 74, "plot": "Separated by a checkpoint, Palestinian lovers from Jerusalem and Ramallah arrange clandestine meetings.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Mzc0MDQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc2ODkyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1033516800000, "runtime": 92, "title": "Divine Intervention", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Suleiman utilizes absurdist humor to craft a provocative, original film.", "critic": {"meter": 81, "numReviews": 68, "rating": 7.2}, "dvd": 1121126400000, "fresh": 55, "lastUpdated": 1442168322000, "production": "Avatar Films Domestic Theatric", "rotten": 13, "viewer": {"meter": 78, "numReviews": 2268, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.avatarfilms.com/releases/divine_intervention.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Elia Suleiman"], "year": 2002}
