Jorge is a morbidly shy Ecuadorian dishwasher toiling away in a shabby Jamaica, Queens, New York diner run by Rick. He works all day long in the shadow of the ever-present Heimlich Maneuver instruction poster which hangs in the diner kitchen. From his solitary kitchen corner, Jorge gropes mutely for a bond with Amy, the newly hired Chinese waitress and even though she tries to reciprocate, the gulf that separates them may be too large. On the job he is continually tormented by his coworker Jerry and at home in his Harlem boarding, under the psychological control of his domineering 'roomate,' he battles his inner demons. Set in the vicinity of JFK airport, the most culturally diverse neighborhood in the world, Choking Man captures the feeling of claustrophobia and almost literal asphyxiation newcomers to America experience as they struggle to find a place and purpose in this strange land.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 457302, "rating": 6, "votes": 455}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-02 00:30:30.527000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The social anxiety of a morbidly shy Ecuadorian dishwasher working in a Queens diner provides the psychological engine that powers this blend of drama and magical realism.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NzI2NDg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg4MzgzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1226620800000, "runtime": 85, "title": "Choking Man", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Quirky animated interludes fail to lift this dull US immigrant indie out of its introverted torpid state.", "critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 34, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1217894400000, "fresh": 17, "lastUpdated": 1441997583000, "production": "IFC", "rotten": 17, "viewer": {"meter": 37, "numReviews": 660, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.chokingman.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Steve Barron"], "year": 2006}
