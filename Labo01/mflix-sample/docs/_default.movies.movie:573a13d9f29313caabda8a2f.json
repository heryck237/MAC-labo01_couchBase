A young Amish girl, Katie Burkholder, survived the terror of the Slaughterhouse Murders. In the aftermath of the killings, the town was left with a sense of fragility, a loss of innocence, and for Katie, the realization that she no longer belonged with the Amish. Now, a wealth of experience later, Kate Burkholder is back. Her Amish roots and big city law enforcement background make her the perfect candidate for Chief of Police. She's certain she's come to terms with her past--until the first body is discovered in a snowy field. Kate vows to stop the killer before he strikes again. But to name him, she would betray both her family and her Amish past and expose a dark secret that could destroy her.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 2234451, "rating": 6.3, "votes": 1085}, "languages": ["English", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:16:03.937000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A murder investigation in her hometown triggers deep-seated emotions in an Ohio police chief who came from the Amish community.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQ1MDE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc3NjA2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-PG", "released": 1357430400000, "runtime": 84, "title": "An Amish Murder", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1435349128000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 0, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Malone"], "year": 2013}
