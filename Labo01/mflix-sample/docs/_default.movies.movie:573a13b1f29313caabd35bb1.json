Chris shows us clips of \"Walking\" and \"Street Musique,\" Ryan's ground-breaking shorts. We now see Ryan as he is: emaciated, alcoholic, much of his mind gone; we meet Felicity Fanjoy, his love during his creative period, and Derek Lamb, his producer. Ryan talks to Chris in the dining hall of what is probably a homeless shelter or soup kitchen. Chris tries an intervention. We follow Ryan out into the street where he panhandles. The animation, which uses live footage, reveals the ravaged burned-out graceful man.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Animation", "Short"], "imdb": {"id": 414469, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 2169}, "languages": ["English", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:31:40.153000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The movie talks about the life of Ryan Larkin, a gifted Canadian animator of the late '60s and the early '70s.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4Mzk4Njc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAyNTg2Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "TV-PG", "released": 1110758400000, "runtime": 14, "title": "Ryan", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1122940800000, "lastUpdated": 1439661907000, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 1287, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=970453"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2004}
