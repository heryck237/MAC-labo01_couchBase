The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 181151, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 7779}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:17:45.303000000", "metacritic": 41, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A highly-evolved planet, whose denizens feel no emotion and reproduce by cloning, plans to take over Earth from the inside by sending an operative, fashioned with a humming, mechanical ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4ODgzNDU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI1Njc2._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 952041600000, "runtime": 105, "title": "What Planet Are You From?", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Though What Planet Are You From? has some laughs, it's too inconsistent and bland for critics to give it their recommendations.", "critic": {"meter": 42, "numReviews": 77, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 963878400000, "fresh": 32, "lastUpdated": 1441217901000, "production": "Columbia Pictures", "rotten": 45, "viewer": {"meter": 28, "numReviews": 5933, "rating": 2.5}, "website": "http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/whatplanet"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Garry Shandling (story)", "Michael Leeson (story)", "Garry Shandling (screenplay)", "Michael Leeson (screenplay)", "Ed Solomon (screenplay)", "Peter Tolan (screenplay)"], "year": 2000}
