But lately his attentions have been on his next endorsements, not on his next game. What\u00e8s more, Roy's temper has run amuck, leading to his being banned from college ball until he can demonstrate compliance--in other words, not explode every time he walks onto the court. Roy waits and waits; for a suitable coaching offer, but he receives only one: the Mount Vernon Junior High School Smelters basketball squad. Roy reluctantly accepts the offer, hoping that a few weeks at the school will prove his good intentions and restore him to his high-living ways as a celebrated college coach. But when old school meets middle school, Coach Roy doesn't know what hit him. It's not until Roy decides to teach his young charges some new concepts--like passing, rebounding, dribbling, and scoring--that the Smelters begin to find success and Roy finds something long thought lost: his love of the game.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 376108, "rating": 5.1, "votes": 10013}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-14 17:30:37.490000000", "metacritic": 36, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "An acclaimed college basketball coach is demoted to a junior varsity team after a public meltdown.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMTU0ODM4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODY2ODM3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1120176000000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Rebound", "type": "movie", "writers": ["William Wolff (story)", "Ed Decter (story)", "John J.
