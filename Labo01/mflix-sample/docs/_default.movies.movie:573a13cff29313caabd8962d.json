Mikio inherited the business and the flat from his father who passed away two years ago. Temporarily living with them is Mikio's divorced sister Seiko, who is there until she decides what to do, which is in her mind - unrealistically - to go abroad to learn English. Their rather dull and staid lives are punctuated by Eriko's pet parakeet having recently flown away, it which they are scouring the neighborhood looking for, and their neighbors organizing a neighborhood watch to keep out undesirables, namely foreigners who they believe are causing no good to their society. Into their lives stumbles Hanataro Kagawa, the son of their father's old friend. Before they know it, Kagawa has talked his way into a job working at the print shop and room and board in their flat. Kagawa turns their lives upside down and inside out with one surprising move after another. But he also uncovers some core issues which are slowly tearing the Kobayashis apart without them really knowing it. What they are unaware of is that Kagawa had a grand plan in his entrance into their lives and home, that will forever change their lives, if only deep in their souls.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1733147, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 186}, "languages": ["Japanese", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:10:34.600000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The film follows the follies that ensue when a man and his wife shack up with a family that owns a printing press in their building, the husband takes it over, and the couple begin inviting a motley crew of friends.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NTE5MDUzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAzMjM5OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1301702400000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Hospitalit\u00e8", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439922262000, "production": "Film Movement", "viewer": {"numReviews": 23, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2010}
