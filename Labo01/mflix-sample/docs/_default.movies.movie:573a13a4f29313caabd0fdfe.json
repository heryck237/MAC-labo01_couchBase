Carol and Bobby have a special affection for one another including sharing a kiss \"by which all others will be measured\". Bobby lives with his mother, a bitter, vain woman who looks for pleasures for herself without sharing much with her son. Into their lives comes a mysterious new boarder, who befriends the boy but generates distrust from the mother. As time passes, the man and boy share confidences and special powers are revealed. The man warns the boy to be on the lookout for the \"lowmen\", who were seeking him. The two share a summer's adventures and come to love one another before the inevitable happens. A confrontation with a school bully also changes everyone.", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery"], "imdb": {"id": 252501, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 28888}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:41:47.337000000", "metacritic": 55, "plot": "A widowed mother and her son change when a mysterious stranger enters their lives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFjNWNmYWUtZTFlMi00ZDcxLWJkY2MtNjMwYmM0OTc5OTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1001635200000, "runtime": 101, "title": "Hearts in Atlantis", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$23.6M", "consensus": "Hearts in Atlantis is well-acted and beautiful to look at, but the movie is nothing more than a mood piece.", "critic": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 135, "rating": 5.7}, "dvd": 1090886400000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1441910998000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 68, "viewer": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 23354, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.heartsinatlantis.net"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Stephen King (book)", "William Goldman (screenplay)"], "year": 2001}
