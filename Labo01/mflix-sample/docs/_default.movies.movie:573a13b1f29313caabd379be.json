He has heart problems, seeks a transplant, and then goes in search of a son sired years before in Tahiti. Told elliptically, with few words, we see Louis as possibly heartless, ignoring a son who lives nearby who is himself an attentive father to two young children, one named for Louis. He leaves his bed one night - and his lover - to kill an intruder; he dreams, usually of violence. Will his body accept his heart? Will his son accept his offer?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 422491, "rating": 7, "votes": 1235}, "languages": ["French", "English", "Korean", "Russian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:36:21.287000000", "metacritic": 85, "plot": "Louis Trebor, a man nearing 70, lives alone with dogs in the forest near the French-Swiss border.
