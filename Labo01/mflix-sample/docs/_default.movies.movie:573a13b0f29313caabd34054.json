They have everything they need to survive yet another boring Sunday: an apartment without parents, videogames, porn magazines, soft drinks and pizza delivery. The electricity company, Rita, the neighbor, Ulises, a pizza deliveryman, eleven seconds, the Real Madrid-Manchester game, some chocolate brownies and a horrible painting of ducks, all combine to break the harmony of what promised to be a placid Sunday, and reveal issues such as the parents' divorce, loneliness, the confusion between adolescent love and friendship, as well as frustration in adult life. \"Temporada de Patos\" is a movie that shows that, when the lights go off, we can see the stars.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 407246, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3120}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-11 00:09:15.623000000", "metacritic": 74, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Flama and Moko are fourteen years old; they have been best friends since they were kids.
