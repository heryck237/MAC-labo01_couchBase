Kaji works with Okishima (S\u00e8 Yamamura) and he implements a better treatment to the laborers and improves the mine production. When the feared Kempetai (The \"Military Police Corps\", the military police arm of the Imperial Japanese Army from 1881 to 1945) brings six hundred Chinese POWs to the mine, Kaji negotiates with their leaders expecting them to control their comrades. However the methods of Kaji upset the corrupt system in the site, and the foreman Furuya (K\u00e8ji Mitsui) plots a scheme to use the naive Chen (Akira Ishihama) to turn off the electrical power of the barbwire fences to allow the prisoners to escape. When seven prisoners are falsely accused of an attempt of fleeing, a cruel Kempetai sergeant uses his sword to behead the prisoners. When Kaji protests, the POWs react sparing the lives of four prisoners but Kaji is arrested and tortured. When he is released, he is summoned to join the army and accused of being Red.", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 53114, "rating": 8.5, "votes": 3297}, "languages": ["Japanese", "Mandarin"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 01:10:12.423000000", "plot": "A Japanese pacifist, unable to face the dire consequences of conscientious objection, is transformed by his attempts to compromise with the demands of war-time Japan.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODc3NDc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5MTM1Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -317174400000, "runtime": 208, "title": "The Human Condition I: No Greater Love", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 9, "rating": 7.7}, "dvd": 1252368000000, "fresh": 8, "lastUpdated": 1440185731000, "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 748, "rating": 4.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Zenz\u00e8 Matsuyama (screenplay)", "Masaki Kobayashi (screenplay)", "Jumpei Gomikawa (novel)"], "year": 1959}
