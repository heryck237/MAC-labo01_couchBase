They are Amine, about eight years old, playful and asthmatic, and Tahir, 15, handsome, quiet, his brother's protector. The boys go in search of their father, and find only trouble. Dad's leaving also debilitates their mother. The movies, a musical uncle, a village Koran school, a poster of a Moroccan beach, and a young deaf woman figure in the resolution.
