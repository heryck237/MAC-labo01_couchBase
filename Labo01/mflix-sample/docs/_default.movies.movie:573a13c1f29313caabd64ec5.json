In the spring of 1988, they're in Kurdistan, at an isolated mountain clinic, waiting for an offensive. David's had enough - he wants to go home to Dublin to his pregnant wife. He leaves, with Mark promising to follow in a few days. A week or so later, Mark's home after being wounded, but David's not been heard from. Mark's slow recovery and uncharacteristic behavior alarm his girlfriend, Elena, who asks her grandfather, a Spanish psychologist, to come to Dublin to help.

Is he a casualty of war?", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 1217070, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 8351}, "languages": ["English", "Kurdish", "Spanish", "Swahili", "French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:35:42.263000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The wife of a photojournalist sets out to discover why he came home from a recent assignment without his colleague.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkzOTIyNjE0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY5MDY5Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1258070400000, "runtime": 99, "title": "Triage", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1281398400000, "lastUpdated": 1440184441000, "production": "NEM", "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 1631, "rating": 3.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Danis Tanovic", "Scott Anderson (book)"], "year": 2009}
