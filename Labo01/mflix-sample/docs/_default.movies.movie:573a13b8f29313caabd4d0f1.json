Jacques is on his fifth or sixth heart attack, and he wants Lucas to run the bar after he dies. Jacques has many rules: don't be friendly, don't serve walk-ins, no food or flowers or candles, put the cash in the freezer every night. Lucas, on the other hand, has a good heart: he gives his money away, he talks to customers, and, when April, a young French woman who has washed out of flight-attendant school, enters the bar chilled to the bone, Lucas takes her in. If Jacques won't tolerate April, what will Lucas do?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 808285, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 3392}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-03 01:19:29.210000000", "metacritic": 40, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A cantankerous but ailing bartender takes a kindly young homeless man in under his wing.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MzgyNDM1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIzODIyMw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1268784000000, "runtime": 99, "title": "The Good Heart", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 31, "numReviews": 35, "rating": 4.6}, "dvd": 1281398400000, "fresh": 11, "lastUpdated": 1440615527000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 24, "viewer": {"meter": 58, "numReviews": 1575, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://www.thegoodheartfilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dagur K\u00e8ri"], "year": 2009}
