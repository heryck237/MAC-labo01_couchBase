In 1877, President Grant opened the Valley to white settlement, and the Nez Perc\u00e8 were given 30 days in which to move to the Lapwai Reservation. The government sent the one-armed soldier-chief, General Oliver Otis Howard, to clear all Nez Perc\u00e8 out of Wallowa Valley. Chief Joseph, in a succession of shrewd military actions, outmaneuvered ten pursuing units of the U.S. Army until his outnumbered band -- sick, starving, and tired -- finally surrendered after a 1700-mile, 108-day fighting retreat. On October 8, 1877, Chief Joseph made his noble speech, \"from where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\"", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 73138, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 455}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 04:41:00.787000000", "plot": "In a period when many thought that \"the only good Indian is a dead Indian,\" Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce won the admiration of the American Public.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MzAyMjk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM5NTM0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 166665600000, "runtime": 105, "title": "I Will Fight No More Forever", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1173744000000, "lastUpdated": 1437936037000, "viewer": {"meter": 74, "numReviews": 458, "rating": 3.9}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeb Rosebrook", "Theodore Strauss"], "year": 1975}
