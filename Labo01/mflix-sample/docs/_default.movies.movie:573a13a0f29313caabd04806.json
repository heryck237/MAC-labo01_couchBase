Nearly 30 speak, describing atrocities personally committed or witnessed, telling of inaccurate body counts, and recounting the process of destroying a village. The atrocities are casual, seem routine, and are sanctioned or committed by officers. Images from the war illustrate the testimony; there's a side discussion among veterans about racism and a couple of interviews about the soldiers' self-realization. The testimony appears in the US Congressional Record on April 6 and 7, 1971. A \"winter soldier\" contrasts with Paine's \"summer soldier and sunshine patriot.\"", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 204058, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 720}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-05 03:29:30.070000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "For three days in 1971, former US soldiers who were in Vietnam testify in Detroit about their war experiences.
