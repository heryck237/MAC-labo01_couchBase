Rosa gets Maya a job as a janitor: a non-union janitorial service has the contract, the foul-mouthed supervisor can fire workers on a whim, and the service-workers' union has assigned organizer Sam Shapiro to bring its \"justice for janitors\" campaign to the building. Sam finds Maya a willing listener, she's also attracted to him. Rosa resists, she has an ailing husband to consider. The workers try for public support; management intimidates workers to divide and conquer. Rosa and Maya as well as workers and management may be set to collide.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 212826, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 4328}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-27 00:12:16.607000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Two Latina sisters work as cleaners in a downtown office building, and fight for the right to unionize.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1MDU1NjQtNGYyNS00NWU1LThlZDYtMTNkZDFkOWM1M2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 972432000000, "runtime": 110, "title": "Bread and Roses", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Bread and Roses has powerful moments, but it also sometimes descends into preachiness.", "critic": {"meter": 65, "numReviews": 63, "rating": 6.1}, "dvd": 1006819200000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1441995402000, "production": "Lions Gate Releasing", "rotten": 22, "viewer": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 3961, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.breadandrosesthemovie.com"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Paul Laverty (screenplay)"], "year": 2000}
