His volatile editor, Lotterman, assigns him to tourist pieces and horoscopes, but promises more. Paul rooms with Sala, an aging and equally alcoholic reporter, in a rundown flat. Sanderson, a wealthy entrepreneur, hires Paul to flack for a group of investors who plan to buy an island near the capital and build a resort. Sanderson's girl-friend, the beguiling Chenault, bats her eyes at Paul. His loyalties face challenges when he and Sala get in trouble with locals, when a Carnival dance enrages Sanderson, and when the paper hits the skids. Is the solution always alcohol?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 376136, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 81723}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:40:09.040000000", "metacritic": 56, "plot": "American journalist Paul Kemp takes on a freelance job in Puerto Rico for a local newspaper during the 1960s and struggles to find a balance between island culture and the expatriates who live there.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODA4MjYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM3NTE5Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1319760000000, "runtime": 120, "title": "The Rum Diary", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bruce Robinson (screenplay)", "Hunter S.
