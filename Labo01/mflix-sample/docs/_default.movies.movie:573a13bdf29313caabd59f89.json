He drinks and eats pizza. Recent stucco work has left a brown stain in a patio wall, and, to Henry's irritation, Esperanza, a neighbor, is certain she can see the face of Jesus in the stain. She brings her priest, then others. Meanwhile, Henry hears his conversations replayed over the fence in another neighbor's yard: it's Millie, about 7, mute, clutching a tape recorder. He tells Millie's mom why he's sad and angry. The face on the wall seems to shed a tear of blood. Is Henry beyond feeling any emotion?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1029120, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 10818}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 00:04:34.673000000", "metacritic": 44, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Henry Poole moves in to a house in his old neighborhood, to spend what he believes are his remaining days alone.
