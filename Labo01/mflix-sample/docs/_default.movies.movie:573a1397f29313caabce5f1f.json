Members of the Palestinian Black September Movement kill two and hold nine others as hostages to exchange for hundreds of Arab prisoners in Isreali jails. The Isreali government adheres to its policy of not negotiating with terrorists, and German Holocaust guilt will not permit West German officials to allow the terrorists to leave the country with the hostages. Therefore, it falls to Chief of Police Manfred Schreiber to delay fulfilling the Palestinian demands through ongoing negotiation, but sooner or later he knows that tough decisions will have to be made.", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 74085, "rating": 6.4, "votes": 637}, "languages": ["English", "Hebrew"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:48:22.640000000", "plot": "A dramatization of the incident in 1972 when Arab terrorists broke into the Olympic compound in Munich and murdered 11 Israeli athletes.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3Mzc0MzczNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTY0Mjg5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 216172800000, "runtime": 101, "title": "21 Hours at Munich", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1135036800000, "lastUpdated": 1440615295000, "production": "MGM", "viewer": {"meter": 53, "numReviews": 1816, "rating": 3.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Edward Hume (screenplay)", "Howard Fast (screenplay)", "Serge Groussard (book)"], "year": 1976}
