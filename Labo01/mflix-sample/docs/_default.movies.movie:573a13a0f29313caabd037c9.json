They're 11, and both want to play in the NBA, just like Quincy's dad. Their love-hate relationship lasts into high school, with Monica's edge and Quincy's top-dog attitude separating them, except when Quincy's parents argue and he climbs through Monica's window to sleep on the floor. As high school ends, they come together as a couple, but within a year, with both of them playing ball at USC, Quincy's relationship with his father takes an ugly turn, and it leads to a break up with Monica. Some years later, their pro careers at a crossroads, they meet again. It's time for a final game of one-on-one with high stakes.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Sport"], "imdb": {"id": 199725, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 13085}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:35:10.790000000", "metacritic": 70, "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "In 1981 in L.A., Monica moves in next door to Quincy.
