When new Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature, they're going to need a bigger boat.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 73195, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 368812}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:13:49.240000000", "metacritic": 79, "num_mflix_comments": 426, "plot": "When a gigantic great white shark begins to menace the small island community of Amity, a police chief, a marine scientist and grizzled fisherman set out to stop it.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVmODY1MzEtYTMwZC00MzNhLWFkNDMtZjAwM2EwODUxZTA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 172454400000, "runtime": 124, "title": "Jaws", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Compelling, well-crafted storytelling and a judicious sense of terror ensure Steven Spielberg's Jaws has remained a benchmark in the art of delivering modern blockbuster thrills.", "critic": {"meter": 97, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 9.1}, "dvd": 963273600000, "fresh": 70, "lastUpdated": 1442077904000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 939241, "rating": 3.5}, "website": "http://www.jaws25.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Peter Benchley (screenplay)", "Carl Gottlieb (screenplay)", "Peter Benchley (based on the novel by)"], "year": 1975}
