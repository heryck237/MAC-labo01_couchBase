Film clips from more than 30 Hudson films illustrate ways in which his sexual orientation played out on screen. First we see tenuous and unresolved relationships with women, then clips of Rock with men, cruising and circling. Next comes pedagogical Eros: Hudson with older men. We see Rock with his sidekicks, often Tony Randall. We look in depth at comedies of sexual embarrassment and innuendo: films in which Hudson sometimes plays two characters, \"macho Rock and homo Rock.\" He's masculine yet vulnerable, a hunk who needs taking care of. Last come cinematic reflections on death.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 105268, "rating": 5.9, "votes": 226}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-02 00:16:05.213000000", "plot": "Documentary about the career and eventual death from AIDS of actor Rock Hudson.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NjgyODUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAyMDAyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "runtime": 63, "title": "Rock Hudson's Home Movies", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1112659200000, "lastUpdated": 1439576428000, "production": "Water Bearer Films Inc.", "viewer": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 117, "rating": 2.7}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Mark Rappaport"], "year": 1992}
