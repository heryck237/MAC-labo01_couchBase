When released, he calls on the family of the victim; they send him away, but not before he has seen Gong-ju, a young woman disabled severely by cerebral palsy. Both are abused by their families, and both are used by them as well. Although their relationship begins with Jong-du's criminal behavior, a friendship develops. They talk of favorite things; he washes her hair; they go out; in late night phone calls, he helps her past her fears of the dark. Is there a place in the world for these two inarticulate people?", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 320193, "rating": 8, "votes": 5145}, "languages": ["Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:24:44.913000000", "metacritic": 79, "plot": "Jong-du, a young man just out of prison for manslaughter, is a social misfit: fidgety, snuffling, laughing inappropriately, without a super ego.
