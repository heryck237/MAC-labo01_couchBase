Rising with xenophobia with Mexican immigration and their taste for smoking marijuana, we see the establishment of a wrong headed federal drug policy as a crime issue as opposed to a public health approach. Fueled by prejudice, hysterical propaganda and political opportunism undeterred by voices of reason on the subject, we follow the story of a costly and futile crusade against a substance with debatable ill effects that has damaged basic civil liberties.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 214730, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3236}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:23:04.147000000", "metacritic": 64, "plot": "The history of the American government's war on marijuana in the 20th century.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MzM5Mjg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE5MjgxMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 963532800000, "runtime": 80, "title": "Grass", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 20, "rating": 6.4}, "dvd": 1112659200000, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1440356871000, "production": "Unapix", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 2522, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Solomon Vesta"], "year": 1999}
