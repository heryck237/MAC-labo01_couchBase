They describe the memory to the staff who work with a crew to film it and screen it at week's end; eternity follows. 22 dead arrive that week, assigned to three counselors and a trainee. One old man cannot find a memory, so he watches videotape of his life. Others pick their memory quickly, and the film crew gets right to work. The trainee, 18-year-old Shiori, helps a teenage girl choose a memory other than Disneyland. The youthful staff have a secret and feelings, too, which play out, especially Shiori's affection for her mentor, Mochizuki", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 165078, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 6683}, "languages": ["Japanese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 00:07:40.500000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "After death, people have just one week to choose only a memory to keep for eternity.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MTg3OTIwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg1MDIyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 924307200000, "runtime": 118, "title": "After Life", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "After Life is an offbeat and tender exploration of memory, love, and life after death.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 26, "rating": 7}, "dvd": 966297600000, "fresh": 22, "lastUpdated": 1440185774000, "production": "Artistic License", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 6660, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Hirokazu Koreeda"], "year": 1998}
