During a tempest, Nicolas is seriously wounded, and Z\u00e8-do-Burro, out of despair, makes a promise: to carry a cross as large as Christ's, to the altar of Saint Barbara - the nearest being in the city of Bahia. He vows to do so in a Candombl\u00e8 session, dedicated to the goddess Yansan - that in the popular belief corresponds to that Christian saint. Nicolas fully recovers from his illness, and Z\u00e8-do-Burro produces a large cross with his own hands and tools, and then carries it on foot to Bahia, accompanied by his wife, Rosa. He has to stay by the church's closed door, and the only person who comes to meet them is Bonit\u00e8o, the local pimp, who offers to take Rosa to a pension while Z\u00e8-do-Burro keeps his promise of staying by the cross. Next morning, the priest is surprised but satisfied with the faith shown by Z\u00e8-do-Burro - until the detail that the promise had been done in a Candombl\u00e8 session comes up in conversation. Then, Olavo the priest berates Z\u00e8-do-Burro for his impiety, and forbade him entrance to the church. The local zealots back him up. A crowd is gathering for the procession and feast in honor of Saint Barbara, including Rosa, who is soon attacked by Marly, the local whore, out of jealousy of her having stayed the night in the company of the handsome gigolo. The women's fight causes a disturbance of the peace. The black people perform a Capoeira fight in her honor, in front of the church. A scandals' reporter adds to the confusion with his insinuation that Z\u00e8-do-Burro may be a communist agitator, or a blessed man. The police is called by the zealots, because Z\u00e8-do-Burro tried to force the door to the church using the cross as a battering-ram. The police officers order Z\u00e8-do-Burro to go away from the church, but he faces up to them. There's a brawl, a shot is heard, the people escape this way and that, and Z\u00e8-do-Burro lies dead by his cross. It's then that the black people take Z\u00e8-do-Burro's body, put it on the cross, and carry him inside the church to the altar of his favorite saint - unopposed.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 56322, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1505}, "languages": ["Portuguese"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-29 01:06:42.827000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A simple yet devout Christian makes a vow to Saint Barbara after she saves his donkey, but everyone he meets seems determined to misunderstand his intentions.
