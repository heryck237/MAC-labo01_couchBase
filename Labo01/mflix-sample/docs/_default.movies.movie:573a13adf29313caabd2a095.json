He's volatile, driven by the love of performing, ambition, perfectionism, and belief that he's living on borrowed time. He begins in the Bronx: a fatherless lad learning music and dance from his mom. His career starts slowly, then \"Splish Splash\" puts him at the top of the charts and on \"Bandstand.\" He wants to be an entertainer, not a pop star, so he aims for the Copacabana; then it's on to the movies, where he meets and marries Sandra Dee. After, it's balancing career, health, marriage and family life, balances he doesn't always keep. Throughout, conversations with his boyhood self give him perspective.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 363473, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 12193}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:23:04.517000000", "metacritic": 46, "plot": "A swooning study of \"Mack the Knife\" singer Bobby Darin (Spacey) specifically, and his relationship with his wife Sandra Dee (Bosworth).", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MzI0ODE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODI4NDM3._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1104278400000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Beyond the Sea", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$6.1M", "consensus": "Kevin Spacey's bio of singer Bobby Darin is either a fearless piece of showmanship or an embarrassing vanity project, according to critics.", "critic": {"meter": 42, "numReviews": 153, "rating": 5.2}, "dvd": 1118102400000, "fresh": 65, "lastUpdated": 1439495192000, "production": "Lions Gate Films", "rotten": 88, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 17824, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.beyondtheseathemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kevin Spacey", "Lewis Colick"], "year": 2004}
