The town officials tell the citizens to ignore them cause there's nothing that they can do. But one citizen (Kaye) who's a death camp survivor says that he was told this nearly forty years ago in Germany and before he knew it he was in a concentration camp. He says this time if they march, he will not ignore them; he will take action. So, the mayor does what he can to stop them, so the Nazi's leader (Dzundza) goes to the ACLU, and the Jewish lawyer (Rubinstein) he speaks to, says that this is a violation of the First Ammendment and takes the case to court.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 83090, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 259}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:14:49.907000000", "plot": "A dramatization of the controversial trial concerning the right for Neo-Nazis to march in the predominately Jewish community of Skokie.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTk5ODY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg5MzgyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 374803200000, "runtime": 125, "title": "Skokie", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1054252800000, "lastUpdated": 1436209176000, "viewer": {"meter": 40, "numReviews": 88, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ernest Kinoy"], "year": 1981}
