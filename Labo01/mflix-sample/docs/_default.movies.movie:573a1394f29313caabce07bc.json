Being overlooked and understanding German, she learns of the repressive attitude of the regent and the plans of his reformist, pro-German minor son, King Nicholas, to take over power by surprise, but doesn't dodge and tries to reconcile father and son. The queen-dowager decides to make her lady-in-waiting for the coronation day, so she stays in the picture to everyone else's surprise.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 50861, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 5308}, "languages": ["English", "French", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:24:19.383000000", "plot": "An American showgirl becomes entangled in political intrigue when the prince regent of a foreign country attempts to seduce her.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUzNmViYWEtMzI4Ni00YzQ0LThmYmMtZmJkNjIxODUzZWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": -396144000000, "runtime": 115, "title": "The Prince and the Showgirl", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 7, "rating": 5.9}, "dvd": 1010448000000, "fresh": 6, "lastUpdated": 1440094812000, "production": "Warner Bros.", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 55, "numReviews": 4429, "rating": 3.3}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Terence Rattigan (by)", "Terence Rattigan (screenplay)"], "year": 1957}
