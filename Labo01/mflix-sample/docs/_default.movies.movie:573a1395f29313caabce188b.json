After a bizarre screening process made up of written exams, physical agility exercises, and interview questions such as \"Do you drink to forget your troubles?\" (Domenico and Antonietta are no older than 17 or 18), they land jobs in the \"Technical Division\" and \"Typing Services\" respectively. From there, Domenico works as an underutilized errand boy until a clerk position is vacated by the death of an older employee. Domenico finally takes his place in a room of 12 other clerks with a manager overseeing them from a desk at the head of the room. The film ends as Domenico ponders his fate, from behind his tiny desk at the back of the small windowless room, listening to the sound of the mimeograph machine as it runs off carbon copies next to the manager's desk.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 55320, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 2692}, "languages": ["Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:33:50.367000000", "plot": "A very young college graduate attempts to obtain a position with a large corporation.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFjYThhMDQtMGNiNC00NWRkLTgyY2MtZDk0ODkxNmJjMjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzk4OTI2MjM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": -261964800000, "runtime": 93, "title": "Il Posto", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1432148873000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 0, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ettore Lombardo", "Ermanno Olmi"], "year": 1961}
