Speaking at his funeral, Mark Antony said of Caesar, \"The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\" With a firm grasp of Reagan's story, Jarecki avoids the predictable and takes the long view on Reagan's life and influence, while staying centered on him as a man of deep contradiction; an American whose patriotism paradoxically led him to impeachable acts, a liberal Democrat who came to define the modern conservative movement.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 1822382, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 670}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-03 00:46:51.037000000", "plot": "Reagan examines the enigmatic career of one of the revered architects of the modern world - icon, screen star, and two-term president Ronald Reagan.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTAwMDMzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgwNzI0NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1295740800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Reagan", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1441997558000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 5, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Eugene Jarecki"], "year": 2011}
