Inspired by children's educational ABC books, the motion picture is comprised of 26 individual chapters, each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet. The directors were then given free reign in choosing a word to create a story involving death. Provocative, shocking, funny and ultimately confrontational; THE ABC's OF DEATH is the definitive snapshot of the diversity of modern horror. Drafthouse Films, Magnet Pictures and Timpson Films are proud to present this alphabetical arsenal of destruction orchestrated by what Fangoria calls \"a stunning roll call of some of the most exciting names in horror across the world.\"", "genres": ["Comedy", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 1935896, "rating": 4.7, "votes": 12577}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "Japanese", "German", "French", "Korean"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:02:02.807000000", "metacritic": 43, "plot": "A 26-chapter anthology that showcases death in all its vicious wonder and brutal beauty.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNTA0OTIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3MTM2Nw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1366934400000, "runtime": 129, "title": "The ABCs of Death", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$21.7k", "consensus": "As is often the case with anthology films, The ABCs of Death is wildly uneven, with several legitimately scary entries and a bunch more that miss the mark.", "critic": {"meter": 35, "numReviews": 65, "rating": 4.8}, "dvd": 1369094400000, "fresh": 23, "lastUpdated": 1442253359000, "production": "Magnolia Pictures", "rotten": 42, "viewer": {"meter": 24, "numReviews": 10317, "rating": 2.3}, "website": "http://www.26waystodie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ant Timpson (based on a nightmare by)", "Nacho Vigalondo", "Adri\u00e8n Garc\u00e8a Bogliano", "Ernesto D\u00e8az Espinoza", "Marcel Sarmiento", "Simon Rumley", "Jon Schnepp (segment)", "Dimitrije Vojnov", "Yudai Yamaguchi (segment)", "Noboru Iguchi (segment)", "Simon Barrett", "Ti West", "Kaare Andrews", "Bruno Forzani", "H\u00e8l\u00e8ne Cattet", "Yoshihiro Nishimura (segment)", "Srdjan Spasojevic", "Lee Hardcastle (segment)"], "year": 2012}
