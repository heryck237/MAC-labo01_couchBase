In 1966, Yash and Sheel Suri leave India for a temporary stay in England while he burnishes his resume as a doctor. He buys projectors, tape recorders, and movie cameras, and sends one set to India beginning a 40-year exchange of tapes and Super 8 movies between his family in India and his household near Manchester. We watch their three daughters grow and we hear increasingly plaintive calls from Yash's parents and sister to return home. In 1982, it's back to India where Yash sets up a practice. A return to England, one daughter's marriage, another's move to Australia, and the third's film project complete the 40-year story. Yash still loves his homeland.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 490984, "rating": 7, "votes": 145}, "languages": ["Hindi", "English"], "lastupdated": "2014-11-09 01:55:07.820000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The myth of return.
