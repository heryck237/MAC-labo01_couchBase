While playing, young T\u00e8rlich falls unconscious onto a duck nest and is carried away forever by the small river. Sixteen years later, Germany, in the Ruhrpott, to be exact: Orphan T\u00e8rlich and his friend Josch are working their civil service, yet cause so much chaos that they decide to flee instead of being forced into the army. T\u00e8rlich accidentally stumbles across some information about his origin and decides to go to Klein Ischgl in Austria. Upon arrival, Josch and T\u00e8rlich find Ischgl to be a center for apr\u00e8s ski parties, and drink hard to blend in. Klein Ischgl actually turns out to be a stone-age-like townlet (9 inhabitants) up the mountain, and T\u00e8rlichs grandfather, who runs the place, even resists to electricity and indoor plumbing. While T\u00e8rlich rediscovers his roots (and his affection for Heidi), Josch finds out that evil entrepreneur Tronald Dump plans to blow the mountain to smithereens in order to erect a plastic mountain with a ski resort where you never can get hurt. Josch now has to convince T\u00e8rlich about the evil intentions of Dump fast, only has there just been quite a fight between the two lifelong friends.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 277703, "rating": 3.2, "votes": 897}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-06-29 00:56:09.780000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Two friends who are doing civil service flee to the Austrian Alps to escape being forced into the army.
