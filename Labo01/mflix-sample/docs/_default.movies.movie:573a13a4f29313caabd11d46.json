Trueba drapes walls with single colors - red for Jerry Gonz\u00e8lez and the Fort Apache band, white for Tito Puente; his camera is close to faces, instruments, hands, and feet; bands' colors contrast with walls or their leader's clothes. Chucho Vald\u00e8s does a pyrotechnic solo then joins his aged father Bebo for a subdued duet. Puntilla R\u00e8os takes us to Africa, Chano Dom\u00e8nguez to a marriage of jazz and Flamenco, and Eliane Elias, her shoe-less foot on the pedal, to gorgeous and muscular elegance. With Paquito, Cachao, Patato, Chico, Gato, and Michel Camilo, we travel Calle 54.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 260775, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 642}, "languages": ["French", "Spanish", "English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 00:10:57.223000000", "metacritic": 84, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "A film featuring performances of several stars of the Latin Jazz music scene.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjUyNTQ5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE1NTAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 970790400000, "runtime": 105, "title": "Calle 54", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A loving tribute to Latin Jazz artists where music does the talking.", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 47, "rating": 7.3}, "dvd": 1005609600000, "fresh": 41, "lastUpdated": 1442337074000, "production": "Miramax Films", "rotten": 6, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 1176, "rating": 3.8}, "website": "http://www.miramax.com/movie/calle-54"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Fernando Trueba"], "year": 2000}
