His long-time art dealer, Ronny, is now an ungracefully aging hipster who desperately wants his meal ticket back. But Lars refuses to paint. His creativity comes at too high a cost - his inspiration is carnage - blood, guts and limbs. Not surprisingly, this lead to a dreadful breakdown in the past. Nevertheless, an eager Ronny arranges a teaching job for Lars at an art school in Koda Lake, a small Canadian town in the middle of nowhere. It's a \"therapeutic\" measure for Lars - a means to conquer his need to paint in the \"safety\" of a country retreat... That is, until Eddie comes into his life.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Horror"], "imdb": {"id": 1480658, "rating": 5.6, "votes": 1201}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 20:39:38.040000000", "metacritic": 57, "plot": "A painter struggling for inspiration finds an unexpected muse after he accepts a teaching position in a small town and becomes the caregiver to Eddie, a seemingly docile art student with a rare sleepwalking condition.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMDA3NTUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0MDMzOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "NOT RATED", "released": 1365120000000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$1.5k", "critic": {"meter": 56, "numReviews": 16, "rating": 5.5}, "dvd": 1375747200000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1437418211000, "production": "Doppelg\u00e8nger Releasing", "rotten": 7, "viewer": {"meter": 54, "numReviews": 313, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/Eddiemovie"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Boris Rodriguez (screenplay)", "Jonathan Rannells (story)", "Alex Epstein (story)"], "year": 2012}
