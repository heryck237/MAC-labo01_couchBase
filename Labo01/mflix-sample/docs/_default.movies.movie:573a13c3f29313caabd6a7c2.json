He's a Manhattan lawyer, seeking forgiveness. She's moved on, focusing on real estate sales. As he walks her to an appointment one evening, pleading his case, they witness a murder; the murderer sees them. The FBI wants them in witness protection until the killer is caught. He's already hunting them. The FBI sends them to Ray, Wyoming, a tiny ranch town, where they stay with the aging sheriff and his gun-toting wife (who's his deputy). Meryl and Paul must sort out their relationship while their New York ways bump up against those of the West. Meantime, Meryl knows two things that Paul doesn't.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1314228, "rating": 4.7, "votes": 27748}, "languages": ["English", "Ukrainian", "Italian", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:41:20.733000000", "metacritic": 27, "plot": "In New York City, an estranged couple who witness a murder are relocated to small-town Wyoming as part of a witness-protection program.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUzMDY0NDYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgxMDI5Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1261094400000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Did You Hear About the Morgans?", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$29.6M", "consensus": "It gets a certain amount of mileage out of the inherent likability of its stars, but with an unfunny script and a lack of onscreen chemistry, Did You Hear About the Morgans? falls flat.", "critic": {"meter": 12, "numReviews": 119, "rating": 3.4}, "dvd": 1268697600000, "fresh": 14, "lastUpdated": 1442511084000, "production": "Sony Pictures/Columbia", "rotten": 105, "viewer": {"meter": 27, "numReviews": 387583, "rating": 2.5}, "website": "http://www.didyouhearaboutthemorgans.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Marc Lawrence"], "year": 2009}
