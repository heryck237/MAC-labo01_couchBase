In L.A., Bill Holt handcuffs Sean Rickhart inside a rebar frame for a freeway pillar at a construction site; Bill's going to bury Sean in quick-drying cement. Guided by the narration of Nin, Bill's coke-snorting partner, we go back and forth over the past 48 hours to find out what brings Bill and Sean to this deadly scene. Missing money, cops on the take, Sean's two brothers (one the leader of the mob, the other a camera-carrying simpleton), Bill's wife, dead young police officers, infidelity, and Bill and Nin's partnership make a mix as volatile and unstable as the cement is solid and immobile.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 138353, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 498}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:11:51.010000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "What's the bond between partners, between brothers, and between spouses?
