Lovecraft (1890-1937), one of the early 20th century's masters of gothic-horror literature. The film offers an encounter with Lovecraft and enters into his world. Engaging in a kind of game around the writer, the film playfully winks at some of the themes characteristic of his work: the occult, cursed books, monstrous creatures. Out of Mind draws its inspiration from Lovecraft's personal correspondence and many of his stories, carrying the viewer through a labyrinth \"beyond the wall of sleep.\"", "genres": ["Horror", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 213968, "rating": 7.2, "votes": 178}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-05-17 00:45:06.740000000", "plot": "Haunted by disturbing dreams from an inherited book, a young man becomes interested in the writings of H.P.
