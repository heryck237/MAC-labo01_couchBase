The school's parent council discusses her punishment. One parent, a psychologist, suggests that her behavior is not abnormal or worthy of expulsion. He describes teen girls' experiments with sex, and these dramatized vignettes, interspersed with man-in-the-street interviews with young women about their attitudes and experiences, make a case for 60's generation's attitude of independence. The girls argue for telling the truth in the face of post-war German convention. In the end, will Renata be expelled or recognized as a girl from a new era?", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 66341, "rating": 4.7, "votes": 386}, "languages": ["German"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:39:27.883000000", "plot": "Mockumentary about German schoolgirls openly talking about their scandalous sexual experiences.
