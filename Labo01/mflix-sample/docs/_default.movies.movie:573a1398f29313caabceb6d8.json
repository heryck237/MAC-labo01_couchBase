Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary. Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time \"for all mankind.\"", "genres": ["Documentary", "History"], "imdb": {"id": 97372, "rating": 8.2, "votes": 3212}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:18:23.650000000", "plot": "This movie documents the Apollo missions perhaps the most definitively of any movie under two hours.
