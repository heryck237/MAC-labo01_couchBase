She's loquacious to a fault. When kids at a career day make fun of her for being single, she accepts a blind date with Steve, the cameraman for a CNN-like news network. Within minutes she decides he's the man for her. He's quickly put off by her constant verbiage and over-the-top advances; he makes an off-hand remark about going on the road with her, and splits. She's moonstruck, writes a sappy crossword puzzle, loses her job, and decides to follow him as the news team crisscrosses the Southwest; Steve's team eggs her on. Then she falls in a mine shaft, and she and Steve become a story; is it a love story?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 881891, "rating": 4.8, "votes": 30915}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 02:12:46.270000000", "metacritic": 17, "plot": "Convinced that a CCN cameraman is her true love, an eccentric crossword puzzler trails him as he travels all over the country, hoping to convince him that they belong together.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5MTQxOTE2OTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY5NzI4NzI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1252022400000, "runtime": 99, "title": "All About Steve", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$33.8M", "consensus": "All About Steve is an oddly creepy, sour film, featuring a heroine so desperate and peculiar that audiences may be more likely to pity than root for her.", "critic": {"meter": 7, "numReviews": 135, "rating": 2.6}, "dvd": 1261440000000, "fresh": 9, "lastUpdated": 1442347986000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 126, "viewer": {"meter": 30, "numReviews": 465475, "rating": 2.8}, "website": "http://www.allaboutstevemovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Kim Barker"], "year": 2009}
