Running into the Bigtop, he is an accidental sensation with his hilarious efforts to elude the police. The circus owner immediately hires him, but discovers that the Tramp cannot be funny on purpose, so he takes advantage of the situation by making the Tramp a janitor who just happens to always be in the Bigtop at showtime. Unaware of this exploitation, the Tramp falls for the owner's lovely acrobatic stepdaughter, who is abused by her father. His chances seem good, until a dashing rival comes in and Charlie feels he has to compete with him.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 18773, "rating": 8.1, "votes": 16017}, "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 12:49:42.070000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The Tramp finds work and the girl of his dreams at a circus.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3Mjg0NzUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk5MTE3MzE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "runtime": 71, "title": "The Circus", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 18, "rating": 8.5}, "dvd": 949968000000, "fresh": 18, "lastUpdated": 1440698830000, "production": "Allied Artists", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 6507, "rating": 4.2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Charles Chaplin"], "year": 1928}
