When Harold sees Amanda sitting alone, he decides to introduce himself. Instructed not to mention his profession to her, Harold doesn't correct Amanda when she mistakingly assumes he is a writer. When she asks who his agent is, Harold innocently throws out the name of super-agent Arthur Blake. Amanda is impressed and charmed, and to Harold's amazement she proposes a date to discuss her next movie with him. As their relationship grows, so must Harold's charade to keep Amanda from discovering he is a Beverly Hills tour guide and not a hot-shot writer.
