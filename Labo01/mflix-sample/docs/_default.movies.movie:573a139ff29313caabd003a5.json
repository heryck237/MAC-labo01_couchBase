By accepting the European voyage his parents offer as graduation present, Charlie crosses their plan to earn a down-payment in summer. So Jenny seeks a job, hastily enough to apply for photocopy-clerk in Oliver Caldwell's multinational HQ. By mistake, Oliver hires her as nanny for his beloved brats, Alex and Katie, who spend summer with him, unlike the school year with their aunt. Businesswise he keeps traveling to Paris and further trough Europe, ultimately meeting Charlie in Austria. Coached by limousine driver Nigel Kent, Jenny proves the first nanny the kids can't scare off. They even bond and team up against Oliver's fianc\u00e8e, ruthlessly ambitious, child-hating VP Vivian Berger, who wants to get rid of them.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 185895, "rating": 6, "votes": 1442}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-24 01:04:50.320000000", "plot": "A young MBA mistakenly takes the job of looking after a rich executive's spoiled children.", "released": 935280000000, "runtime": 96, "title": "Au Pair", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439232769000, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 852, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jeff Sherman (story)", "Jeff Sherman (teleplay)", "Cheryl Saban (teleplay)"], "year": 1999}
