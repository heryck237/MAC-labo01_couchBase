The recital of the pair's outrageous reality quickly took on a life of its own. This darkly funny documentary chronicles the history of Raymond and Peter, as well as what happened to former slackers Eddie and Mitch, who paint a picture of not only their outrageous neighbors, but also of San Francisco's Lower Haight neighborhood in the late 1980s. Interviews with others who were influenced by the recordings document their broad influence on a variety of artists, near and far.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1766085, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 867}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-20 00:55:13.500000000", "metacritic": 57, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "When two friends tape-recorded the fights of their violently noisy neighbors, they accidentally created one of the world's first 'viral' pop-culture sensations.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjI5MzgzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg0Nzk0NA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1314230400000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Shut Up Little Man!
