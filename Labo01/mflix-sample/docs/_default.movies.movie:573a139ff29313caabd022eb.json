He also tells the doctor, after a few sessions, that he's attracted to a young woman he's met in the waiting room. She's Sarah, 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he's married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off. In flashbacks we see him get his start as a killer, at his father's prompting: it's the family business. Dad gives Alex his next assignment: to kill the therapist. Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage, and his malaise.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 194218, "rating": 6.8, "votes": 6950}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 00:48:13.623000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 4, "plot": "Alex, a hit man, tries to get out of the family business, but his father won't let him do so.
