They apply to the Rock-A-Bye Adoption Agency, and are assigned Miss Novick as an investigator. Through a farfetched mis-communication she gets a very bad impression of Augie Poole and indicates her report will be unfavorable. Through even more far-fetched circumstances, Augie is able to change Miss Novick's mind, and later comes to believe the baby she is carrying is his. Rock-A-Bye does find the Pooles a baby, and Augie is convinced it is Miss Novick's, and that he is the real father...so much so that his wife comes to believe it, too. She threatens to leave him, but all the misunderstandings are finally cleared up for a happy ending.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 52325, "rating": 6, "votes": 695}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-16 11:37:49.537000000", "plot": "The Pooles are unable to have a baby after years of trying.
