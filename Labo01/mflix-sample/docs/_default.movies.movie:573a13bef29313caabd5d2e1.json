She is released temporarily from the facility to attend her sister Rachel Buchman's wedding. During her release, Kym is staying at the family home, where the wedding is taking place. As such, it is like Grand Central Station for the duration of Kym's stay, which may not be the most conducive situation for her in constantly being exposed to the watching eyes of those who know and don't yet know her, but know of her situation. The reunion with her family members starts off well enough, but issues around Kym's release from rehab quickly surface. Kym and Rachel's father, Paul Buchman, wants to make sure that Kym is all right at all times, which to Kym feels instead like he doesn't trust her. Rachel slowly begins to resent Kym's situation taking over what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life, some of which is directed by Kym, some of which isn't. One person present but largely not included in the last minute wedding planning work is Kym and Rachel's mother, Abby, from who Paul is divorced. The two have since married other people. Outwardly, Abby has been nurturing of Kym throughout her life. However, what is one of the key moments in Kym's drug induced life, and in their collective family's lives, may profoundly affect the wedding. Beyond how Kym's presence affects the wedding, the goings-on of the family during Kym's short stay may either bring them closer together or tear them apart.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1084950, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 39445}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-22 00:29:34.313000000", "metacritic": 82, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A young woman who has been in and out from rehab for the past 10 years returns home for the weekend for her sister's wedding.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTQ0MzQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY1NDI5MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1226016000000, "runtime": 113, "title": "Rachel Getting Married", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$12.7M", "consensus": "Rachel Getting Married is an engrossing tale of family angst, highlighted by Anne Hathaway's powerful performance and director Jonathan Demme's return to form.", "critic": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 190, "rating": 7.4}, "dvd": 1236643200000, "fresh": 161, "lastUpdated": 1440270274000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 29, "viewer": {"meter": 62, "numReviews": 37472, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/rachelgettingmarried"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jenny Lumet"], "year": 2008}
