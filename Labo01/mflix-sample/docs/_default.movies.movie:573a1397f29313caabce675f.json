Rich, elderly Don Alejo is poised to sell the town for a profit, needing only to buy a whorehouse to own all the buildings and close the deal. It's owned by a man and his daughter: Manuelita is gay, aging, afraid; he cross-dresses and entertains as a flamenco dancer; he wants to sell and leave. His daughter wants to stay. The return of Pancho complicates things: he's a hothead Alejo tries to control and he scared Manuelita the year before. Things come to a head as Pancho breaks Alejo's hold on him, then flirts and dances with Manuelita and finds himself at risk of being called a \"maric\u00e8n.\"", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 76336, "rating": 7.7, "votes": 530}, "languages": ["Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:20:57.243000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Family honor, greed, machismo, homophobia, and the dreams of whores collide in a Mexican town.
