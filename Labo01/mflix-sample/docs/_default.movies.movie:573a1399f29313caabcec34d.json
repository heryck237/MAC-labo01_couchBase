He decides to surprise each with a visit and finds none as he imagined. The film is a veritable travelogue across contemporary Italy, as Matteo journeys to Naples, Rome, Florence, Milan, and Turin to search for each of his children; he even spends one night on the streets among the homeless. Scuro returns to Sicily, visits his wife's grave, and reports with irony that \"stanno tutti bene.\"", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 100681, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 2283}, "languages": ["Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-08 00:37:27.740000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Matteo Scuro is a retired Sicilian bureaucrat (responsible mainly for the writing of birth certificates), a widower with five children, all of whom live on the mainland and hold responsible...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFlYWJiNzUtOGI4Ny00MDJiLTk3ZDEtMjg1N2JjNjBkMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2OTg4Mjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 675648000000, "runtime": 118, "title": "Everybody's Fine", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 5, "rating": 6.8}, "dvd": 709948800000, "fresh": 5, "lastUpdated": 1442081755000, "production": "Erre Produzioni", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 649, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Massimo De Rita", "Tonino Guerra", "Giuseppe Tornatore"], "year": 1990}
