In this installment in Burns' \"American Lives\" series, the two 2-hour episodes explore a side of Twain that is unfamiliar to many. Widely regarded as the funniest person of the 19th century, Twain suffered through severe personal tragedies and lack of business sense that brought him to the brink of financial ruin on several occasions. Includes interviews with writers William Styron and Arthur Miller and actor Hal Holbrook (who has portrayed Twain in a one-man play each year for over 50 years).", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "imdb": {"id": 306355, "rating": 8.3, "votes": 496}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-05 00:20:57.240000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A biographical film about the acclaimed American humourist and author.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTUyNTQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTY4NjA5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1010966400000, "runtime": 212, "title": "Mark Twain", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1438454451000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 19, "rating": 4.1}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Dayton Duncan", "Geoffrey C.
