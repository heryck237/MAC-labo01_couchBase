Douglas and Joe chat in front of a New Jersey music store, and a band is born: as Douglas's sister tells us, it's one of many that don't make it. We follow Douglas from high school (1963-64), when he sees himself as a loser, into the band, playing drums and singing backup - then as the front man. There are tensions, a breakup, an audition in front of a major player, and decisions. Douglas pursues Grace, a country-club gal with hip sensibilities who believes in him. There's also his father, working class, wanting Douglas to apply himself as he watches his own life fill with regrets.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1230215, "rating": 6, "votes": 3500}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-21 00:43:50.173000000", "metacritic": 65, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Set in suburban New Jersey the 1960s, a group of friends form a rock band and try to make it big.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU2NDU2MzIyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk2NTY1OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1374192000000, "runtime": 112, "title": "Not Fade Away", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1271721600000, "lastUpdated": 1436899595000, "viewer": {"meter": 0, "numReviews": 72, "rating": 2}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["David Chase"], "year": 2012}
