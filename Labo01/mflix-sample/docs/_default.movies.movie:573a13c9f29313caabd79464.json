The engineer, who calls himself captain and poses in Napoleon hat and uniform with epaulets, is distracted by a lady who enters the engine car looking for a small, black dog. The captain accompanies her back through a car of swells in top hats. The fireman, a small and polite but dutiful man, sees danger ahead and searches for the captain. The train is low on fuel with a high mountain in front and a ruined behind, so the fireman calls on the passengers to donate fuel. The swells negotiate with a carload of revelers, so all might end well. But what of the captain, lady, dog, and cow?", "genres": ["Animation", "Short", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1520380, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 185}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-03-29 01:32:20.767000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A train runs into a cow on the tracks; with the captain nowhere to be found, the fireman is forced to desperately improvise in order to keep the train going.", "released": 1244419200000, "runtime": 9, "title": "Runaway", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1439488835000, "viewer": {"numReviews": 0, "rating": 0}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Cordell Barker"], "year": 2009}
