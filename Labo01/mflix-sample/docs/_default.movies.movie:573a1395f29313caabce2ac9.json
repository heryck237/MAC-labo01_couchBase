Sex is not used as the working-class boy's way to 'the top'. Executive status has no appeal for Alfie. Nor has class mobility. He is quite content to stay where he is, as long as the 'birds' are in 'beautiful condition', as he assures us they are in one of the candid, over-the-shoulder asides to the camera which the film carries over from \"Tom Jones\". The film shows how much of the 'swinging 60's' quality of London life was a male creation, and through the dominance of the fashion photographers, a male prerogative.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 60086, "rating": 7.1, "votes": 9864}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-01 00:04:49.723000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "An unrepentant ladies' man gradually begins to understand the consequences of his lifestyle.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE4NTdiMzItYjcyNi00YmY3LTkzZTEtZmJjMGZmNjM5ZDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -105926400000, "runtime": 114, "title": "Alfie", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 100, "numReviews": 24, "rating": 7.9}, "dvd": 983232000000, "fresh": 24, "lastUpdated": 1440011026000, "production": "Paramount Pictures", "rotten": 0, "viewer": {"meter": 76, "numReviews": 14504, "rating": 3.4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Bill Naughton (screenplay)", "Bill Naughton (based on the play: \"Alfie\")"], "year": 1966}
