We watch the group dwindle until only two brothers are left. One brother is watched by his nephews who will keep him alive at all costs, the other lives in ill health and poverty as the only support of his fairly stupid grandson. Statues and bodies are switched, in the wrong boxes until everyone is sure someone has died. Now if they can only make it seem as if the other brother died first, hundreds of thousands of pounds (in Victorian England when a pound was a pound) will be theirs.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 61204, "rating": 7, "votes": 2261}, "languages": ["English", "Swahili"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-29 00:28:46.567000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In Victorian England, a fortune now depends on which of two brothers outlives the other... or can be made to have seemed to do so!", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJkMDAyODctMTliMi00M2Y4LWEyZTYtOGYzNzZlNWEwYjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -110332800000, "runtime": 105, "title": "The Wrong Box", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 17, "rating": 6.8}, "fresh": 15, "lastUpdated": 1438024897000, "production": "Columbia Pictures Corporation", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 73, "numReviews": 702, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Robert Louis Stevenson (suggested by a novel by)", "Lloyd Osbourne (suggested by a novel by)", "Larry Gelbart (written for the screen by)", "Burt Shevelove (written for the screen by)"], "year": 1966}
