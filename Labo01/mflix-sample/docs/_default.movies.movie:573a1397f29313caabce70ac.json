The mission: To seek out a mysterious Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, whose army has crossed the border into Cambodia and is conducting hit-and-run missions against the Viet Cong and NVA. The army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane and Willard's job is to eliminate him! Willard, sent up the Nung River on a U.S. Navy patrol boat, discovers that his target is one of the most decorated officers in the U.S. Army. His crew meets up with surfer-type Lt-Colonel Kilgore, head of a U.S Army helicopter cavalry group which eliminates a Viet Cong outpost to provide an entry point into the Nung River. After some hair-raising encounters, in which some of his crew are killed, Willard, Lance and Chef reach Colonel Kurtz's outpost, beyond the Do Lung Bridge. Now, after becoming prisoners of Kurtz, will Willard & the others be able to fulfill their mission?", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 78788, "rating": 8.5, "votes": 408025}, "languages": ["English", "French", "Vietnamese", "Khmer"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-04 00:36:40.273000000", "metacritic": 90, "plot": "During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNkZmU0ZWQtZjQzMy00YTNmLWFmN2MtZGNkMmU1OThmMGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 303523200000, "runtime": 153, "title": "Apocalypse Now", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Francis Ford Coppola's haunting, hallucinatory Vietnam War epic is cinema at its most audacious and visionary.", "critic": {"meter": 99, "numReviews": 77, "rating": 8.9}, "dvd": 1006214400000, "fresh": 76, "lastUpdated": 1442081239000, "production": "United Artists", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 281614, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=films&action=show_one&film_id=13"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["John Milius", "Francis Ford Coppola", "Michael Herr (narration)"], "year": 1979}
