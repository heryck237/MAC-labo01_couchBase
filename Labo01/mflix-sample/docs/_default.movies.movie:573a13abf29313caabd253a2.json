For the youth political movement, seemingly ineffectual methods of peaceful protest and resistance led to the rise of a faction that wanted a more extreme approach that the government could not ignore. One particular group, the Weather Underground, attempted to team up with the Black Panthers to violently confront the US government. They began with participation in street riots, and escalated their efforts to include the bombing of specific targets associated with the government or local power structures. Through archival footage and interviews of participants on both sides of this conflict, this film covers the Weather Underground's campaign of violence through this period, the FBI's strategies and tactics to apprehend them (including some deemed unethical or illegal), until changing times and disillusionment brought their activities to an end.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 343168, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 2881}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-16 00:21:01.120000000", "metacritic": 77, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The remarkable story of The Weather Underground, radical activists of the 1970s, and of radical politics at its best and most disastrous.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTU5Njc3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA2NzUyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1068681600000, "runtime": 92, "title": "The Weather Underground", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Fascinating documentary about the militant Weathermen.", "critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 57, "rating": 7.8}, "dvd": 1085443200000, "fresh": 52, "lastUpdated": 1442083834000, "production": "Indican Pictures", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 86, "numReviews": 4005, "rating": 3.9}, "website": "http://www.theweatherunderground.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2002}
