His wife Nelle, who sometimes abuses drugs, spoils his ingrate teenage stepdaughter Sandy, who is kind only to her sweet, mentally handicapped brother, Jimmy Vandevyver. After a class on sexual abuse from feminist teacher Lydia De Beule, Sandy pretends Rob abused her. Lydia, Rob's ex, eagerly helps her fabricate 'proof', which a female police commissioner eagerly believes. A frustrated judge (and father) shamelessly ignores the legal benefit of the doubt, even tricks Rob while in jail. Nelle discovers more then one sick truth.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 441694, "rating": 5.8, "votes": 169}, "languages": ["Dutch"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-17 00:00:14.127000000", "plot": "15-year-old Lolita unleashes a witch hunt against her stepfather", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4OTM1OTcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ1NjYzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1132099200000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Suspect", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1301270400000, "lastUpdated": 1438366369000, "viewer": {"meter": 64, "numReviews": 296, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Guy Lee Thys"], "year": 2005}
