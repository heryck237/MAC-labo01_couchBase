A pilot dies. His son Bagi, who, like his father, has epilepsy, grows up on the steppes, herding sheep, subject to fits. A plague among the animals forces the family off their land to a city where Bagi gets a mining job. His seizures become more frequent and bring visions in this wasteland of strip mining, factories, and rubble.
