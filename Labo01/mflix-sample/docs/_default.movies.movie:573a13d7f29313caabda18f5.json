Lured by blue skies, sunshine, palm trees, and the promise of a rich social life, they bought their way to paradise for just a $1,500 down payment. Now, as an aging community faces its own mortality, paradise has begun to exact a higher price. Through the experiences of six longtime residents, 'Kings Point' captures both the allure and the darker complexities of living in a world where 'nobody gets too close.' Poignant, funny and dark, 'Kings Point' is a deeply empathetic portrait of the last act of the American Dream.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Short", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 2109153, "rating": 6.7, "votes": 166}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-19 00:02:11.377000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A documentary on five seniors living in a retirement resort in Florida - men and women who came decades ago with their spouses by their sides, and now find themselves grappling with love, loss and the universal desire for human connection.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NDA2NTcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI3MDY5OA@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1350000000000, "runtime": 40, "title": "Kings Point", "tomatoes": {"lastUpdated": 1442252609000, "production": "Wider Film Projects", "viewer": {"numReviews": 5, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "year": 2012}
