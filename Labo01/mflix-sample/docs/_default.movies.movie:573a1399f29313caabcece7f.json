When Princess Jasmine gets tired of being forced to remain in the palace that overlooks the city, she sneaks out to the marketplace, where she accidentally meets Aladdin. Under the orders of the evil Jafar (the sultan's advisor), Aladdin is thrown in jail and becomes caught up in Jafar's plot to rule the land with the aid of a mysterious lamp. Legend has it that only a person who is a \"diamond in the rough\" can retrieve the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin might fit that description, but that's not enough to marry the princess, who must (by law) marry a prince.", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 103639, "rating": 8, "votes": 232663}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-12 00:35:40.703000000", "num_mflix_comments": 410, "plot": "When a street urchin vies for the love of a beautiful princess, he uses a genie's magic power to make himself off as a prince in order to marry her.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q2NDI1MjUtM2Q5ZS00MTFlLWJiYWEtNTZmNjQ3OGJkZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 722649600000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Aladdin", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "A highly entertaining entry in Disney's renaissance era,\" Aladdin is beautifully drawn, with near-classic songs and a cast of scene-stealing characters.", "critic": {"meter": 94, "numReviews": 66, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1096934400000, "fresh": 62, "lastUpdated": 1441904641000, "production": "Buena Vista Distribution Compa", "rotten": 4, "viewer": {"meter": 92, "numReviews": 935997, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/aladdin/aladdin.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ron Clements (screenplay)", "John Musker (screenplay)", "Ted Elliott (screenplay)", "Terry Rossio (screenplay)", "Burny Mattinson (story)", "Roger Allers (story)", "Daan Jippes (story)", "Kevin Harkey (story)", "Sue C.
