Because of James's best-seller, Lara's agent, Steve, checks out the little known Hegg Island in Scotland as the site for their next attempted wedding. Unfortunately, James is a hack, and his book (supposedly based on Hegg) relays little of it accurately. Katie, an island native and the only unmarried woman on it, has been unlucky in love. She's working on writing her own guide to Hegg Island when Steve and crew arrive, eventually hiring her as a reluctant decoy bride to distract the paparazzi. In a mix-up, she and James end up married to each other while Lara, having spotted the press, goes into hiding. Katie and James now have to get an island divorce while avoiding the press while other parties seek out Lara (who has disguised herself as one of the elderly islanders).", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 1657299, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 7033}, "languages": ["English", "Scottish Gaelic"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-11 00:01:35.497000000", "metacritic": 42, "plot": "When the world's media descend on the remote Scottish island where a Hollywood actress is attempting to get married, a local girl is hired as a decoy bride to put the paparazzi off the scent.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4ODk4MTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU1NDczNw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG", "released": 1331251200000, "runtime": 89, "title": "The Decoy Bride", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Neil Jaworski", "Sally Phillips (story)", "Sally Phillips"], "year": 2011}
