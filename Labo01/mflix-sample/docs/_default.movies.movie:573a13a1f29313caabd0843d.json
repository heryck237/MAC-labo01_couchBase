It centers on Inez Macbeth, a wisp of a girl just a shade over twenty, who may lack a formal education, but has already been taught plenty by life. She's at a dead end, married to Edgar, a petty thief who had his shot and missed long ago, but is too dense to realize it. She spends her days catering to Edgar's whims and fighting off lame advances from his taciturn partner in crime, Flowers. One day, Butcher Lee, Inez's trusted friend and an amateur mystic of sorts, reveals a vision that Inez's One True Love is close by. Determined not to let this opportunity slip by, she vows to act on that information right away. Unknown to anyone, Inez has begun a secret tryst with Druden, a sweet-spirited, oddly-romantic, and wealthy young lawyer in town. With utter certainty that Druden is The One from Butcher's vision, Inez plans their escape to Richmond. Edgar gets wind Inez is up to something and blows his cool, beating her and making her a prisoner in their own home. These efforts lead Inez to concoct a desperate scheme involving murder, betrayal, and escape. In the ensuing chaos, Inez discovers the thorny side of true love and that finding one's soul mate is never quite what you'd expect.", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 220343, "rating": 4.2, "votes": 1185}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-31 01:13:51.910000000", "plot": "A woman becomes immersed in a brutal love triangle when an unwelcomed admirer kills her abusive husband even though she's already having an affair.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNzI5NDExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkyNzk5._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1043020800000, "runtime": 103, "title": "Briar Patch", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1083628800000, "lastUpdated": 1442346580000, "production": "Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "viewer": {"meter": 71, "numReviews": 526, "rating": 3.5}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Deborah Pryor"], "year": 2003}
