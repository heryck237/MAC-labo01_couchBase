Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1234721, "rating": 6.2, "votes": 166841}, "languages": ["English", "Persian"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-10 17:15:11.287000000", "metacritic": 52, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy - a loving husband, father and good cop - is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyOTUzMTcxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjkyOTc1MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1392163200000, "runtime": 117, "title": "RoboCop", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$58.6M", "consensus": "While it's far better than it could have been, Jos\u00e8 Padilha's RoboCop remake fails to offer a significant improvement over the original.", "critic": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 191, "rating": 5.6}, "dvd": 1401753600000, "fresh": 93, "lastUpdated": 1442510871000, "production": "Sony Pictures Releasing", "rotten": 98, "viewer": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 126491, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.robocop.com/site"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joshua Zetumer", "Edward Neumeier", "Michael Miner", "Edward Neumeier", "Michael Miner"], "year": 2014}
