It begins with an abstract battle of light and darkness set to the music of Beethoveen's Fifth Symphony. Then we see the adventures of a Humpback Whale calf and his pod set to \"The Pines of Rome.\" Next is the humourous story of several lives in 1930's New York City, scored with \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" Following is a musical telling of the fairy tale, \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" set to Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. Then a goofy Flamingo causes havoc in his flock with his yo-yo to the tune of the finale of \"Carnival of the Animals.\" This is followed by the classic sequence from the original film, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" starring Mickey Mouse and followed by \"Pomp and Circumstance\" starring Donald Duck as a harried assistant to Noah on his Ark. Finally, we see the awesome tale of the life, death and renewal of a forest in a sequence featuring the composition, \"The Firebird.\"", "genres": ["Animation", "Family", "Fantasy"], "imdb": {"id": 120910, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 25328}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-27 00:08:54.963000000", "metacritic": 59, "plot": "An update of the original film with new interpretations of great works of classical music.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE3OGUxNmItZmM3MC00ZTI3LTg0YTUtMzA3MGJkZjkyNjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "G", "released": 961113600000, "runtime": 74, "title": "Fantasia/2000", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "It provides an entertaining experience for adults and children alike.", "critic": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 82, "rating": 7.1}, "dvd": 974160000000, "fresh": 67, "lastUpdated": 1440180674000, "production": "Buena Vista Pictures", "rotten": 15, "viewer": {"meter": 75, "numReviews": 62011, "rating": 3.4}, "website": "http://disney.go.com/DisneyPictures/fantasia2000/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Eric Goldberg (story)", "Hans Christian Andersen (story)", "Joe Grant (original concept)", "Perce Pearce (story)", "Carl Fallberg (story)", "Ga\u00e8tan Brizzi (story)", "Paul Brizzi (story)", "Don Hahn", "David Reynolds", "Irene Mecchi", "Elena Driskill (concept for \"Death & Re-birth of the Forest\")"], "year": 1999}
