He plans to torment Mike Nelson and the robots by sending them a real stinker of a film to watch called, \"This Island Earth.\" He is convinced that this movie will drive them insane. And since the guys cannot control when the movie begins or ends, they are forced to witness the true horror that is this awful movie that has a lobster creature dressed in slacks. But will this be the ultimate cheese that breaks the boys' spirits? It's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil the plans of the scientist and to save the Earth.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "imdb": {"id": 117128, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 14858}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-06 00:05:36.883000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Mike Nelson and his robot companions watch and give their comments about \"This Island Earth\".", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNmN2UzNTAtNmZkMS00MmI3LThhNzEtNjI1YjJlN2JiZjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 829872000000, "runtime": 73, "title": "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie may be thin and uneven, but it's hilarious in enough of the right spots to do the show's big-screen transition justice.", "critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 54, "rating": 6.6}, "dvd": 971136000000, "fresh": 43, "lastUpdated": 1440444844000, "production": "MCA Universal Home Video", "rotten": 11, "viewer": {"meter": 88, "numReviews": 26840, "rating": 3.8}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Michael J.
