Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables' most personal battle yet.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 2333784, "rating": 6.1, "votes": 107172}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-23 00:01:25.063000000", "metacritic": 35, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Barney augments his team with new blood for a personal battle: to take down Conrad Stonebanks, the Expendables co-founder and notorious arms trader who is hell bent on wiping out Barney and every single one of his associates.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU5ODMyMzg2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA2MTcxMjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1408060800000, "runtime": 126, "title": "The Expendables 3", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Like its predecessors, Expendables 3 offers a modicum of all-star thrills for old-school action thriller aficionados -- but given all the talent assembled, it should have been a lot more fun.", "critic": {"meter": 33, "numReviews": 152, "rating": 4.9}, "dvd": 1416873600000, "fresh": 50, "lastUpdated": 1442078492000, "production": "Lionsgate Pictures", "rotten": 102, "viewer": {"meter": 49, "numReviews": 77277, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://theexpendables3film.com/hq"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Sylvester Stallone (screenplay)", "Creighton Rothenberger (screenplay)", "Katrin Benedikt (screenplay)", "Sylvester Stallone (story)", "Dave Callaham (characters)"], "year": 2014}
