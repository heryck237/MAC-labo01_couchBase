Still, there is the question: Should Jan and Sara really get married?", "genres": ["Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 1339122, "rating": 6, "votes": 1542}, "languages": ["German", "Italian"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-01 00:01:00.313000000", "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "When Jan decides to marry his girl-friend Sara, he is not aware of his opponent: her father, who is an Italian patriarch.
