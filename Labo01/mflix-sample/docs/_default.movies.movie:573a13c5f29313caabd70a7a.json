Once the town hero, Ray has returned home to Newfoundland from the US following a drug conviction, only to have his wife Lillian leave him for another man and aspirations of stardom. With Lillian gone, Ray flails from woman to woman trying to find a replacement for her, while struggling against a growing awareness of his homosexuality. At loose ends for lack of guidance, Ruby is becoming increasingly curious about her own sexuality and, in a desperate plea for attention, putting herself in increasingly risky situations.

When Stuart finds himself attracted to Ruby, dangerously motivated by fear and anger, he leads the three of them towards a heartbreaking conclusion.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 1397502, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 220}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-17 00:41:34.313000000", "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of Ruby, 13, determined to grow up fast after her mother runs away to become a movie star, leaving Ruby with her hopelessly rural father.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNjc5NjY0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MzgyMjI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1263945600000, "runtime": 95, "title": "Grown Up Movie Star", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1345507200000, "lastUpdated": 1442079819000, "production": "Mongrel Media", "viewer": {"meter": 72, "numReviews": 119, "rating": 3.6}, "website": "http://grownupmoviestar.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Adriana Maggs"], "year": 2009}
