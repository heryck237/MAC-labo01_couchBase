Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart.", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 100150, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 97127}, "languages": ["English", "Italian", "Irish", "Yiddish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-15 05:15:42.740000000", "metacritic": 66, "plot": "Tom Regan, an advisor to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Njk3MTAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5Mzk4NjE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 655084800000, "runtime": 115, "title": "Miller's Crossing", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Though possibly more notable for its distinctive style than an airtight story, this Coen brothers take on the classic gangster flick features sharp dialogue, impressive cinematography, and a typically quirky cast of characters.", "critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 55, "rating": 8.1}, "dvd": 1053388800000, "fresh": 50, "lastUpdated": 1442082552000, "production": "20th Century Fox", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 49272, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Joel Coen", "Ethan Coen"], "year": 1990}
