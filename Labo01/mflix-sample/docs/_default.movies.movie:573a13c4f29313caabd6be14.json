Although Klansmen bragged openly about what they did in 1964, no one was held accountable until 2005, when the State indicted preacher Edgar Ray Killen, an 80-year-old notorious racist and alleged mastermind of the killings. Through intimate interviews with the families of the victims, candid interviews with black and white Neshoba County Citizens, and exclusive, first time interviews with Killen, the film explores whether healing and reconciliation are possible without telling the unvarnished truth.", "genres": ["Documentary"], "imdb": {"id": 1337155, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 60}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-07-04 00:27:51.223000000", "metacritic": 71, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "NESHOBA tells the story of a Mississippi town still divided about the meaning of justice, 40 years after the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNzU3NzM4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYwMzA2MDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1223769600000, "runtime": 86, "title": "Neshoba", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$19.2k", "critic": {"meter": 87, "numReviews": 15, "rating": 7.5}, "fresh": 13, "lastUpdated": 1436897852000, "production": "First Run Features", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 868, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://neshobafilm.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Micki Dickoff"], "year": 2008}
