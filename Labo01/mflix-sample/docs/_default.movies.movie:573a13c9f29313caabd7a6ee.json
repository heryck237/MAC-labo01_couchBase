It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award\u00e8-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1535109, "rating": 7.9, "votes": 292910}, "languages": ["English", "Somali"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-24 00:10:33.337000000", "metacritic": 83, "num_mflix_comments": 3, "plot": "The true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiZWRhMjctNDUyMS00NmUwLTgwYmItMjJhOWNkZWQ3ZTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1381449600000, "runtime": 134, "title": "Captain Phillips", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$107.1M", "consensus": "Smart, powerfully acted, and incredibly intense, Captain Phillips offers filmgoers a Hollywood biopic done right -- and offers Tom Hanks a showcase for yet another brilliant performance.", "critic": {"meter": 93, "numReviews": 238, "rating": 8.3}, "dvd": 1390262400000, "fresh": 222, "lastUpdated": 1440093910000, "production": "Sony Pictures", "rotten": 16, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 149185, "rating": 4.2}, "website": "http://www.captainphillipsmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Billy Ray (screenplay)", "Richard Phillips (based upon the book \"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates", " Navy SEALS", " and Dangerous Days at Sea\" by)", "Stephan Talty (based upon the book \"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates", " Navy SEALS", " and Dangerous Days at Sea\" by)"], "year": 2013}
