He lucks into civilian clothes, a little bit of money, a passport, and a dog, and he also meets Nelly, a 17-year-old who's grown up too fast. She's the object of lust of men: including a boyfriend Maurice, her putative protector Zabel, and Lucien, a local hood. Jean falls for her, faces down Lucien, and gives her courage to stand on her own feet. A ship is leaving for Venezuela; can at least one of them be on it, or is that just a dream?", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 30643, "rating": 7.6, "votes": 5644}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-02 00:24:41.850000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "A military deserter finds love and trouble (and a small dog) in a smoky French port city.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMDMwMjgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgzMTI0NDE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "APPROVED", "released": -952300800000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Port of Shadows", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$26.8k", "critic": {"meter": 96, "numReviews": 23, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 1090281600000, "fresh": 22, "lastUpdated": 1441220376000, "production": "Rialto Pictures", "rotten": 1, "viewer": {"meter": 90, "numReviews": 2303, "rating": 4.1}, "website": "http://www.rialtopictures.com/portofshadows.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Pierre Dumarchais (novel)", "Jacques Pr\u00e8vert (scenario and dialogue)"], "year": 1938}
