We see a plain-clothes cop, his girlfriend with another man, a mother and child, an American tourist with a video camera, and a Secret Service agent newly returned from medical leave. Shots ring out and the President falls; a few minutes later, we hear a distant explosion, then a bomb goes off in the square. Those minutes are retold, several times, emphasizing different characters' actions. Gradually, we discover who's behind the plot. Is the Secret Service one step ahead, or have the President's adversaries thought of everything?", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 443274, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 121642}, "languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-05 00:00:39.957000000", "metacritic": 40, "plot": "The attempted assassination of the American President is told and re-told from several different perspectives.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjQ5OTY4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk1MDU1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1203638400000, "runtime": 90, "title": "Vantage Point", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$72.3M", "consensus": "Vantage Point has an interesting premise that is completely undermined by fractured storytelling and wooden performances.", "critic": {"meter": 35, "numReviews": 154, "rating": 5}, "dvd": 1214870400000, "fresh": 54, "lastUpdated": 1440180498000, "production": "Sony Pictures Releasing", "rotten": 100, "viewer": {"meter": 57, "numReviews": 373220, "rating": 3.3}, "website": "http://www.vantagepoint-movie.com/index.php"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Barry L.
