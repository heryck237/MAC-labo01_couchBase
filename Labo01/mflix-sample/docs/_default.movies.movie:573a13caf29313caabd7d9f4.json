Spielrain's psychological problems are deeply rooted in her childhood and violent father. She is highly intelligent however and hopes to be a doctor, eventually becoming a psychiatrist in her own right. The married Jung and Spielrein eventually become lovers. Jung and Freud develop an almost father-son relationship with Freud seeing the young Jung as his likely successor as the standard-bearer of his beliefs. A deep rift develops between them when Jung diverges from Freud's belief that while psychoanalysis can reveal the cause of psychological problems it cannot cure the patient.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 1571222, "rating": 6.5, "votes": 74215}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-09-07 00:47:06.533000000", "metacritic": 76, "plot": "A look at how the intense relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud gives birth to psychoanalysis.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5Mjk3NjgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM5MjA5Ng@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1320883200000, "runtime": 99, "title": "A Dangerous Method", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$5.7M", "consensus": "A provocative historical fiction about the early days of psychoanalysis, A Dangerous Method is buoyed by terrific performances by Michael Fassbender, Keira Knightley, and Viggo Mortensen.", "critic": {"meter": 77, "numReviews": 170, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1332806400000, "fresh": 131, "lastUpdated": 1442511617000, "production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "rotten": 39, "viewer": {"meter": 50, "numReviews": 26840, "rating": 3.2}, "website": "http://www.sonyclassics.com/adangerousmethod"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Christopher Hampton (screenplay)", "Christopher Hampton (play)", "John Kerr (book)"], "year": 2011}
