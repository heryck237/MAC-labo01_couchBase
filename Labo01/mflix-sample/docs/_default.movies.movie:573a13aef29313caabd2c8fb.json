For Nuru and her equally competitive sister Dolly, the perfect public Muslim persona is the most important thing in life. Back in London, Alim is free to live openly as a homosexual, of which his mother is not aware. He is in a loving relationship with his live-in British boyfriend, Giles. To navigate through his complicated life, Alim uses the spirit of 'Cary Grant' as his confidante and advisor. Feeling like her life is missing a daughter-in-law as Dolly prepares for her son's \"perfect\" wedding, Nuru decides to reconnect with Alim in London. Not yet ready to tell his mother of either Giles or his homosexual orientation, Alim, with Giles' support, hides any aspect of this fact for Nuru's visit. But as Giles is tested one turn after another during Nuru's visit, both Alim and Nuru begin to understand what is truly important in their lives leading to true happiness.", "genres": ["Drama", "Comedy", "Romance"], "imdb": {"id": 374277, "rating": 6.6, "votes": 3394}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:36:26.227000000", "metacritic": 46, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "A gay Canadian living in London has his perfectly crafted life upset when his devoutly Muslim mother comes to visit.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzc3NjUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTcxNTYyMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1089936000000, "runtime": 91, "title": "Touch of Pink", "type": "movie", "writers": ["Ian Iqbal Rashid", "Ken Chubb (story)"], "year": 2004}
