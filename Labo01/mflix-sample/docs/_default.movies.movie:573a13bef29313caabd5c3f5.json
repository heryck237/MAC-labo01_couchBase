From soldier to anti-war activist, the film takes an unflinching view of the physical and emotional aftermath of war through the eyes of an American hero. The film unfolds on two parallel tracks. On the one hand, we see Tomas evolving into a powerful voice against the war as he struggles to deal with the complexities of a paralyzed body. And on the other hand, we see the historic debate unfolding in the Congress about going to war in Iraq.", "genres": ["Documentary", "War"], "imdb": {"id": 1068634, "rating": 7.8, "votes": 510}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-07 00:01:16.727000000", "metacritic": 60, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "The story of an injured American veteran returning home from the war Iraq is set against the backdrop of a critical indictment of the government's handling of the U.S.-led invasion.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5MTY5MzQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1Mjc1MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": 1192579200000, "runtime": 87, "title": "Body of War", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "Unapologetically political, this intimate and heart wrenching profile of an Iraq veteran may be rough around the edges but takes a potent stance with determination and compassion.", "critic": {"meter": 79, "numReviews": 42, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1205884800000, "fresh": 33, "lastUpdated": 1438976668000, "production": "Phil Donahue Enterprises", "rotten": 9, "viewer": {"meter": 82, "numReviews": 606, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://www.bodyofwar.com/index.html"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Phil Donahue", "Ellen Spiro"], "year": 2007}
