A young technocrat, Miklos Nemeth, becomes Hungary's new prime minister to save the country's appalling economy. He decides to remove the expensive border control apparatus from the state budget. A young couple from East Germany is encouraged by the rumours that the Hungarian border to Austria will be opened and decide to make a go for it. But Nemeth's decision has set him up against formidable adversaries and communist hardliners. The young couple are caught up in the political power-game, and the young man is shot dead at the border. This tragic event paradoxically accelerates Nemeth's final decision to open the borders, and soon after the Berlin wall falls.", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "Thriller"], "imdb": {"id": 4119270, "rating": 7.4, "votes": 113}, "languages": ["English", "Hungarian", "German"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-06 00:20:54.037000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "The political drama of the fall of the Iron Curtain as told by one of its power brokers and the widow of one of its casualties.", "released": 1414800000000, "runtime": 97, "title": 1989, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Erzs\u00e8bet R\u00e8cz", "Anders \u00e8stergaard"], "year": 2014}
