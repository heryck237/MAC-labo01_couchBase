Crumb. Robert Crumb is the cartoonist/artist who drew Keep On Truckin', Fritz the Cat, and played a major pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. Through interviews with his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride through one man's subconscious mind. As stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of Crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. As his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Biography", "Comedy"], "imdb": {"id": 109508, "rating": 8, "votes": 13074}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-12 00:36:10.313000000", "metacritic": 93, "plot": "An intimate portrait of the controversial cartoonist and his traumatized family.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmZGJiYzctOTdhNS00ODhiLTg4NzctNDc1ZDRmOGU1MTJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 799027200000, "runtime": 119, "title": "Crumb", "tomatoes": {"critic": {"meter": 95, "numReviews": 41, "rating": 8.4}, "dvd": 920937600000, "fresh": 39, "lastUpdated": 1440444748000, "production": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "rotten": 2, "viewer": {"meter": 89, "numReviews": 9206, "rating": 4}}, "type": "movie", "year": 1994}
