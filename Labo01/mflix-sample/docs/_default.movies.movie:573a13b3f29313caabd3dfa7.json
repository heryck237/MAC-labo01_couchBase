In Morocco, a troubled married couple are on vacation trying to work out their differences. Meanwhile, a Moroccan herder buys a rifle for his sons so they can keep the jackals away from his herd. A girl in Japan dealing with rejection, the death of her mother, the emotional distance of her father, her own self-consciousness, and a disability among many other issues, deals with modern life in the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan. Then, on the opposite side of the world the married couple's Mexican nanny takes the couple's 2 children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico, only to come into trouble on the return trip. Combined, it provides a powerful story and an equally powerful looking glass into the lives of seemingly random people around the world and it shows just how connected we really are.", "genres": ["Drama"], "imdb": {"id": 449467, "rating": 7.5, "votes": 227715}, "languages": ["English", "Arabic", "Spanish", "Japanese", "Berber languages", "French", "Russian", "Japanese Sign Language"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-26 00:24:26.790000000", "metacritic": 69, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Tragedy strikes a married couple on vacation in the Moroccan desert, touching off an interlocking story involving four different families.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJkZDljNGYtNjRiNC00ZmY2LTg1NmItYTI1MTllNDQzMWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "R", "released": 1163116800000, "runtime": 143, "title": "Babel", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$34.2M", "consensus": "In Babel, there are no villains, only victims of fate and circumstance.
