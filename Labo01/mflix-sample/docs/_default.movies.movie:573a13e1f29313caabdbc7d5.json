After ten years as a band, and five critically acclaimed albums, they were finally enjoying wider recognition. Lead singer Matt Berninger invited his younger brother, Tom, to join the tour's crew. A budding horror filmmaker, Tom - who is nine years younger than Matt and listens exclusively to heavy metal - decided to bring his camera along. Tom's at sea in the world of indie rock, and living in his brother's shadow brings out the younger sibling in him - he drinks, complains, and struggles to balance his ambition with his tour responsibilities. The result is a film about brothers and about making something of your own.", "genres": ["Documentary", "Comedy", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 2737310, "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2976}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-28 01:13:36.033000000", "metacritic": 73, "num_mflix_comments": 1, "plot": "Tom Berninger chronicles his time spent on the road as a member of the tour crew for The National, the rock & roll band fronted by his brother, Matt.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY2MjM1ODMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjU5NjkzMTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 1395964800000, "runtime": 75, "title": "Mistaken for Strangers", "tomatoes": {"boxOffice": "$0.1M", "consensus": "A suitably complicated look at fraternal bonds, Mistaken for Strangers offers more depth and insight than the usual tour documentary.", "critic": {"meter": 91, "numReviews": 57, "rating": 7.6}, "fresh": 52, "lastUpdated": 1442345440000, "production": "Abramorama Entertainment", "rotten": 5, "viewer": {"meter": 85, "numReviews": 2689, "rating": 4}, "website": "http://mistakenforstrangersmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "year": 2013}
