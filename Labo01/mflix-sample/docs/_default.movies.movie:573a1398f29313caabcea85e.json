But Legagneur's laughter and easy intimacy are empty of content for a book, and he's constantly dashing off, promising Wolf more time later. Wolf seems to have his own mask: he's brought a gun with him, and he's curious about a woman who was a recent guest at the estate. There's also Legagneur's godchild, Catherine, recovering from mental illness, and hovered over by Legagneur and his secretary. As Wolf digs through desks, he discovers a murderous plot. Can he now outfox his host?", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "imdb": {"id": 93505, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 841}, "languages": ["French"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-31 00:20:21.950000000", "num_mflix_comments": 2, "plot": "Roland Wolf wants to write a book about a TV game-show host, the hail-fellow-well-met Christian Legagneur, who invites Wolf to his country estate, promising several days of lengthy ...", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NTkwN2EtYjk0Zi00N2NlLWE4MmQtODQxMjRmNmJmMGMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "released": 540000000000, "runtime": 100, "title": "Masques", "tomatoes": {"dvd": 1090886400000, "lastUpdated": 1439231989000, "production": "Criterion Collection", "viewer": {"meter": 63, "numReviews": 271, "rating": 3.6}}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Odile Barski", "Claude Chabrol"], "year": 1987}
