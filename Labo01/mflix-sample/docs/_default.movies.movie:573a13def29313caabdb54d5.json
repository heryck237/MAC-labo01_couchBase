A chance demonstration of that in prison led to a new friend who helped get him out and into a musical career. With his fire and creative daring, Brown became a star who defiantly created new possibilities in show business both on and behind the stage in face of racism and conventional thinking. Along the way, James would also become a peacemaker who redefined and raised the African-American community's feeling of self-worth when it was needed most. However, those same domineering passions would lead James Brown alienating everyone around him as his appetites became ever more self-destructive. Only after he hit rock bottom with a serious mistake does Brown realize what he needs to do make his life as the Godfather of Soul truly worthwhile.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Music"], "imdb": {"id": 2473602, "rating": 6.9, "votes": 12626}, "languages": ["English"], "lastupdated": "2015-08-25 00:02:43.320000000", "metacritic": 71, "plot": "A chronicle of James Brown's rise from extreme poverty to become one of the most influential musicians in history.", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjAyMTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4NzQ4MTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg", "rated": "PG-13", "released": 1406851200000, "runtime": 139, "title": "Get on Up", "tomatoes": {"consensus": "With an unforgettable Chadwick Boseman in the starring role, Get On Up offers the Godfather of Soul a fittingly dynamic homage.", "critic": {"meter": 80, "numReviews": 148, "rating": 6.9}, "dvd": 1420502400000, "fresh": 118, "lastUpdated": 1442137892000, "production": "Universal Pictures", "rotten": 30, "viewer": {"meter": 69, "numReviews": 24751, "rating": 3.7}, "website": "http://www.getonupmovie.com/"}, "type": "movie", "writers": ["Jez Butterworth (screenplay)", "John-Henry Butterworth (screenplay)", "Steven Baigelman (story)", "Jez Butterworth (story)", "John-Henry Butterworth (story)"], "year": 2014}
